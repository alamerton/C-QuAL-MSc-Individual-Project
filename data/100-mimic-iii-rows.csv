Radiology:
CXR [**11-16**]: Diffusely increased opacities at the lung fields
bilaterally. In an immunocompromised patient, this is concerning
for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 2**]. Radiographically, the differential includes
pulmonary edema. Additionally, there is a faint opacity at the
right lung base, which may represent atelectasis or focal
pneumonic process.
.
CT-Head [**11-16**]: Focus of low attenuation within the subcortical
white matter of the right medial frontal lobe. This may
represent a subacute infarction; however, an underlying mass
lesion cannot be completely excluded. An MRI examination with
gadolinium and diffusion-weighted imaging is recommended for
further evaluation. No intracranial hemorrhage noted.
.
MR-head-w&w/o gadolinium [**11-18**]:
Signal abnormality in the medial right frontal lobe involving
the corpus callosum does not demonstrate enhancement. This
finding most likely represent a small infarct. However, in
absence of ADC map, age of the infarct could not be determined.
No abnormal enhancement is seen. Follow up is suggested, if
clinically indicated.
.
Echo [**11-18**]:
1.The left atrium is mildly dilated.
2. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the
aortic valve. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen.
5. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. No mass or
vegetation is seen on the mitral valve. While difficult to
assess given the limited views suspect Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen.
6.The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.
7.There is no pericardial effusion.
.
If clinically indicated, would recommend a TEE.
.
CXR [**11-21**]:
Resolution of congestive failure with persistent small bilateral
pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
.
Studies:
EEG [**11-17**]: This is a mildly abnormal EEG due to the presence of
a slow
and disorganized background with bursts of generalized slowing -
all
consistent with a mild encephalopathy of toxic, metabolic, or
anoxic
etiology. No evidence for ongoing seizures is seen.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  54 woman on immunosuppressive therapy for UC (prednisone,
6MP) who presents with new onset HA, fever with bacterial
meningitis and gram positive rod bacteremia.
.
#. Listeriosis - meningitis and bacteremia. Patient presented
with headache, nuchal rigidity, expressive aphasia, afebrile on
admission but temp to 104.4 in the ED, where she also started to
have rigors.  LP showed >300 WBC, poly predominant with 5%
monocytes, protein 152 glucose 16.  CSF gram stain showed gram
positive rods, blood culture grew gram positive rods, speciation
eventually grew listeria. Empiric treatment based on gram stain
was started: ampicillin and bactrim (to cover both nocardia and
question of PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 3**] below), vanc and ceftriaxone as well pending
confirmation of gram stain and culture results.  Once
speciations was confirmed, a five day course of gentamicin was
started for synergy, and vancomycin and ceftriaxone d/c'd.
Bactrim was maintained on treatment dose for concern for PCP
[**Name Initial (PRE) 4**] [**11-21**], when it was changed to prophylaxis dose.  Early on
admission, she developed hypotension that required levophed, but
was weaned off of pressors within the first couple of days of
admission with PRBCs (total of 4 units) and volume
resussitation.  Given bacteremia, TTE was done, no vegetations
or lesions noted. Head CT on admission showed right medial
frontal lobe likely infarct versus mass lesion, no hemorrhage.
Subsequent MRI confirmed infarct, unclear date, and EEG
consistent with meningitis.  Neurology was consulted, and the
patient was placed on dilantin for seizure prophylaxis given
meningoencephalitis. She spiked fevers to 101-102 over the first
several days of admission.  By [**11-19**], her neurological exam was
markedly improved, and by [**11-21**] her headache was gone, no
meningeal signs noted, although her baseline essential tremor
was slightly more severe. Surveillance blood cultures reamined
negative from [**11-17**] on.  Notably, she was transferred from ICU
to floor on [**11-21**], but noninvasive BP was read as 60/d, patient
mentating well, sent back to ICU. In the ICU, an arterial line
was placed, and consistently read 20-30 mmHg higher than
sphyngomanometer.  This discrepancy was of unclear etiology, but
persistent.  Patient maintained normal mentation, good urine
output, no tachycardia, and it was judged that, for some unclear
reason, the cuff pressures underestimated by 20-30 points.  On
[**11-23**], she was sent to the floor for further care and management.
.
#. Bilateral lung opacities/hypoxia. Initial chest film read as
increased opacities bilaterally concerning for PCP (given
steroids and no PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 5**]) vs. bacterial pneumonia vs. pulmonary
edema. She had signifcant oxygen requirement, and her
respiratory distress led to her being placed on CPAP+PS.  The
origin of her significant hypoxia was originally thought to be
secondary to likely vascular leak from sepsis/CHF versus PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 6**]
induced sputum was attempted, but was unsuccessful, and was not
repeated initally given her unstable respiratory status, and
susbsequent evaluation that likelihood of PCP was small.  She
responded well to lasix diuresis, with reduced O2 requirements.
.
#. UC: She continued to receive her outpatient dose of
prednisone, which was changed on [**11-22**] to dexamethasone IV; her
outpatient 6-MP was held. After several days with no diarrhea,
it recurred on [**11-22**] soon after her diet had advanced. C.diff was
negative. She was made NPO, and fed via TPN for bowel rest.  On
[**11-24**], it was noted that she began passing BRBRP, her hematocrit
was noted to drop two points and pt was typed and crossed and
consent for blood transfusion.
.
#. Anemia. On admission, she was found to be anemic. She
received PRBCs for anemia on admission and again [**11-19**] for mixed
venous sat <70%.  She was found to have iron binding studies c/w
anemia of chronic disease.  Her HCT was followed closely, and
remained stable for the remainder of her admission.
.
#. FEN: Her diet was advanced as tolerated, but she was made NPO
with TPN on [**11-22**] after she developed diarrhea, thought secondary
to continued UC activity.
.
#. Prophylaxis: PPI. Hold SQ Hep, pneumoboots. Initially on
droplet precautions.
.
#. Code status: FULL
.
#. Communication: patient, her sister, brother, and mother
.
#. Lines: peripheral IV x 2. left subclavian CC.  A-line. Eval
for PICC; once in place, can d/c central line, a-line.

Surgery Discharge part:
Pt underwent total abdominal colectomy with ileoostomy on
[**2147-11-26**].  She was on Clinda/Gent peri-procedure and Amplicillin
for 21 days at first.  She was seen by PT/OT and was NPO until
the ostomy started to function.  SHe had c/o nausea as diet was
tolerated and it was slowed down.  MRI was suspicious for an
abcess and amplicillin was started for at least a total of 6
weeks as per ID.  She was given a PICC.  On [**12-5**] she was
cleared by PT and was in good condition for d/c to rehab on
[**2147-12-5**].

History of Present Illness:
61F w/ sign PMH for UC s/p colectomy, Stage II breast cancer
presented on day 13 of second cycle of chemotherapy with fever
to 100.6 at home w/ severe rigors. She took two Ibuprofen at
home and then went to onc clinic today where she was then
referred to the ED for admission. She stated that for the past
two days she has noticed an increasing amount of stool output in
her ostomy bag but denies abdominal discomfort or blood in her
stool. She has had nausea but similar to how she has felt in the
past with chemo. She also mentioned that she recently cut her
finger in the garden on Sunday which is now red and slightly
tender to the touch. She otherwise denies any vomiting, rash,
rhinorrhea, dysuria, cough, SOB or abdominal discomfort. She
denies any recent travel or sick contacts as well.
.
In the ED inital vitals were, Temp: 101 ??????F (38.3 ??????C), Pulse: 93,
RR: 16, BP: 77/38, O2Sat: 94, O2Flow: RA. Her labs were notable
for WBC of 0.7 and PMN count of 21. Her U/A was bland and two
blood cultures were obtained and are pending. His CXR did not
show definitive source of infection either. She was started on
Cefepime for neutropenic fever. While in the ED she developed
hypotension not responding to IVF boluses, the pt denied CVL
placement and required the initiation of phenylepherine
peripherially in order to maintain SBPs in the 90s-100s. She did
not have a change in her mentation during these episodes of
hypotension.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 14**] is a 61 yo w/ Stage II breast cancer who was
admitted on day 13 or cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide who developed fever to 100.6 at home with
associated rigors in the setting of neutropenia.
.
#Neutropenic Fever- On presentation the pt's PMN count was 21
most likely from her most recent chemotherapy cycle and lack of
Neulasta use. Two possible sources of infection existed
including pulmonary or from a laceration on her finger suffered
while gardening. She was broadly covered with Vancomycin and
cefepime to cover both possible sources, as well as flagyl to
cover for cdiff as the patient mentioned that she had increased
ostomy output.  When cdiff returned negative, flagyl was
discontinued. Blood cultures were sent and a U/A was not
concerning for infection. We also sent off galactomannan antigen
and beta-D-glucan labs initially as part of her neutropenic
fever workup which were negative. The following day after
admission her WBC rose significantly and she no longer was
neutropenic. As her WBC rose she started to develope a cough and
he CXR became concerning for an infiltrate. She was continued on
Vanc/Cefepime until afebrile and with ANC>1000 for greater than
48 hours, after which she was switched to PO levofloxacin to
complete an 8 day total course for community acquired pneumonia.
.
# Hypotension- In the [**Name (NI) **] pt's SBP dropped to 70s, not responding
to IVF boluses. She refused central line placement in the ED and
peripheral pressors were initiated. This is most likely related
to her underlying infectious process. She was not administered
any medications recently that could be accounting for her
hypotension. Looking through OMR her baseline blood pressures
are sbp of 90s-100s. An a-line was obtained which showed higher
BP than what was being recorded by the blood pressure cuff. She
was given several liters of IV fluid boluses and weaned off
pressors the night of admission to the ICU. Her cuff and a-line
pressures correlated after fluid resuscitation and the a-line
was discontinued.
.
# Breast Cancer- currently in cycle 2 of Docetaxel (Taxotere) +
Cyclophosphomide. Most likely this current episode of
neutropenia is due to the fact that Neulasta was not given
during this cycle of chemo per pt's request, however due to the
rapid rise in her WBC count myelosuppression from sepsis was
also a possibility.
.
# Depression / Anxiety- Continue Duloxetine and clonazepam at
home doses.
.
# Nausea- Continued compazine and PO zofran prn.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear [**Known firstname 17**],

It was a pleasure to take care of you here at [**Hospital1 18**]. You were
admitted for low white cell (neutrophil count), fever, and
pneumonia. You required monitoring with blood pressure
supporting medications and IV antibiotics in the intensive care
unit. Fortunately, your counts improved and you responded nicely
to the antibiotics. Please continue to take levofloxacin to
treat your pneumonia for a total of 8 days (last dose on
[**2154-5-7**]). As we discussed if you notice fever, worsening
breathing problems, or any other concerning symptoms to return
to the emergency room immediately.

We have made the following changes to your medications:

START levofloxacin 750mg by mouth daily for 4 more days
([**2154-5-7**])

You should discuss with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 19**] the possibility of restarting
neulasta with your next chemotherapy cycle.

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31**] is a 62 y.o. woman with primary progressive MS
[**Name13 (STitle) 32**] in [**2143**] with spasticity s/p intrathecal baclofen pump
placment in '[**64**], s/p tracheostomy in '[**65**] [**1-8**] to chronic
respiratory weakness, recurrent UTIs, aspiration PNAs, who
presents after being found to be febrile and unresponsive at her
nursing home.  According to notes from [**Hospital6 33**], the
pt was found at her nursing home yesterday ([**3-26**]) AM, shaking
her head repeatedly, subsequently becoming obtunded (presumed
seizure). She was taken by EMS to [**Hospital1 34**] ED.
.
In the ED at [**Name (NI) 34**], pts vitals were: Tm 103.6, HR 110-150s RR
12-18 SaO2 98-99%NRB. Soon after, pt supposedly seized in the
ED, was given Ativan, Ambu'd and subsequently placed on SIMV
ventilation. Pt was empirically started on Vancomycin, Levoquin,
Ceftriaxone, Bactrim and Acyclovir. On exam, it was noted that
the skin overlying the baclofen pump (RUQ) appeared inflamed.
Labs were notable for a WBC of 25 with 68%polys and a bandemia
of 20%. U/A with 50-100 WBC, +leukocyte esterase, +nitrite. LP
was performed and CSF analysis showed 7,250 WBCs with 92% polys,
glucose 10, TP 1440, and gm stain with many polys, few gm+
cocci. Bcx revealed gm+ cocci in chains in [**3-9**] bottles. Micro
lab performed latex agglutination on CSF sample which was
positive for group B strep. Vanc and Ceftriaxone were dc'd and
ampicillin 2gm IV + benadryl given. Hydrocortisone 80mg was also
given. Left SC line and NGT were also placed at [**Hospital1 34**]. CXR showed
cardiomegaly but no infiltrate. Abdominal CT was negative for an
abscess or fluid collection surrounding the pump. Head CT showed
questionable changes from prior that might suggest the
possibility of a right MCA infarct. Pt was transferred directly
to the [**Hospital1 18**] MICU for further management.


Past Medical History:
PMH:
1. Chronic progressive multiple sclerosis - dx'd in [**2143**] when pt
was 34 years old; on intrathecal baclofen pump ('[**64**]) for
spasticity
2. Recurrent UTIs and hosp. for urosepsis - thought [**1-8**] to
chronic indwelling Foley catheter for neurogenic bladder. Last
admitted [**Date range (3) 35**] for urosepsis
3. Recurrent aspiration PNA - [**3-/2162**], [**10/2166**] - admitted both times
requiring MICU stay, during '[**65**] admission trach was placed
because was unable to clear secretions on her own [**1-8**] to
respiratory weakness
1/03 admitted for lingular PNA, unclear if [**1-8**] to aspiration
4. COPD
5. HTN
6. Osteoporosis
7. Scarlet fever as a child
8.  Chronic constipation
9. Hx of sacral decubitus ulcer

TTE on admission:
1. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are
normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.
2. No obvious mass or vegetation seen.
.
CT abd post-op:
1) Large hematoma in the superficial tissues of the right upper
quadrant with associated edema and tracking into the abdominal
wall. No extension into the peritoneal space is seen. The
covering intern was notified by telephone at 10:30 a.m. on [**3-28**], [**2171**].

2) Gallbladder with dense material . this could represent
stones, sludge or vicarious excretion of iv contrast. If
clinically indicated, an ultrasound can be obtained for further
characterization.

3) Bilateral small kidneys with small nonobstructing stones.

4) Atelectasis and small pleural effusions at both lung bases.
.
EEG [**2172-3-28**]: This is a markedly abnormal portable EEG due to the

presence of generalized bursts of polymorphic disorganized
slowing
followed by periods of suppression. In addition, there were
independent
bifrontal sharp slow waves seen. This finding suggests deep,
midline
subcortical dysfunction and is consistent with a severe
encephalopathy.
A repeat EEG may be helpful to further evaluate the severity of
the encephalopathy.
.
EEG [**2172-3-31**]: This is an abnormal portable EEG obtained in stage
II sleep
with brief periods of drowsiness due to the presence of
intermittent and
independent shifting slowing in the parasagital region on both
sides.
This finding suggests deep, midline subcortical dysfunction and
is
consistent with the diagnosis of meningoencephalitis. In
addition,
exessive drowsiness was seen, perhaps also related to the
underlying
infection.
.
MRI [**4-4**]: Increased signal along the occipital horns could be
due to cellular debris from meningitis. No evidence of acute
infarct seen. Mild to moderate ventriculomegaly indicating mild
communicating hydrocephalus.
.
MRV [**4-4**]: The head MRV demonstrates normal flow signal in the
superior sagittal and transverse sinus without evidence of
thrombosis. Deep venous system also demonstrates normal flow
signal.
.
MRA [**4-4**]: Somewhat limited MRA of the head due to motion. No
evidence of vascular occlusion seen.
.
TEE:
1.The left atrium is normal in size.
2. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%).
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4.There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5.The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or
vegetations are seen on the aortic valve.
6.The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial
mitral
regurgitation. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve.
7.There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
.
Head CT [**4-7**]: Stable appearance of the ventricles and sulci.


Brief Hospital Course:
1. GBS meningitis/bactermia
In the unit, the pt was continued on Ampicillin and started on
Gentamicin (for synergy). Her intrathecal baclofen pump was
thought to be infected (on exam, erythema and warmth overlying
pump in RUQ). Pt went to surgery to have pump removed and the
operation appeared to be without complication. The following
day, pt had 11 point hematocrit drop and was noted to be
hypotensive with an SBP of 70. After spiking a temp, it was
thought that she might be septic. She was given fluids, PRBCs,
FFP, and placed on Levophed. Abd CT demonstrated a 7 x 13x 11 cm
hematoma in the RUQ at the former pump site. Pt was taken
emergently to surgery where the hematoma was evacuated, slow
ooze noted, and the bleeding vessel cauterized. She returned to
the floor and remained hemodynamically stable. Given 1
additional unit of PRBCs. Her hct bumped appropriately and
remained in the high 20s for the rest of her unit course. Pt
developed erythematous macular rash on face, arms, knees thought
to be [**1-8**] to PCN allergy. Amp was d/c'd and replaced briefly
with Vanc and then changed permanently to Cefrtriaxone. Repeat
LP was performed since the pt continued to be minimially
responsive (withdrawing to pain, occ. opening eyes to name). CSF
analysis showed a resolving bacterial meningitis. Prior to
leaving the unit, pt spiked a temp to 101.2. She was pancultured
and all cultures were negative. A TTE ruled out endocarditis in
the setting of group B strep bacteremia.  On day #12 of
gentamycin, pt was changed to vanc/ceftaz for the completion of
her treatment course.
.
2. RUQ Hematoma: As above, after the removal of the baclofen
pump, pt had a hct drop and hypotensive episode and was found to
be bleeding into the RUQ pocket.  She was taken to the OR for
emergent evacuation of the hematoma.  On POD #16, pt was noted
to have oozing from the a site above the stitches in her RUQ.
Neurosurgery was reconsulted and they recommended an abdominal
ultrasound which showed vast improvement in the RUQ hematoma but
found a new fluid collection.  Surgery was consulted and they
diagnosed a seroma and recommended conservative management given
that it had no signs of infection.
.
3. Pneumonia:
Towards the end of the pt's ICU stay, she was evaluated by
speech and swallow and she had a very difficult time with the
passy-muir valve.  She underwent bronchoscopy and BAL was sent
for culture.  The culture returned positive for MRSA and gram
negative rods (not pseudomonas).  She was started on vancomycin
for MRSA and ceftaz/levaquin for double coverage of the GNR.
Once the GNR sensitivities showed that it was not pseudomonas,
ceftaz was stopped.  Of note, pt had vancomycin troughs that
were persistently high.  Vancomycin troughs should be checked
often and vanc should be adjusted for a level<15.  After the
pt's swallowing study, she was noted to have increased
secretions and some food particles were suctioned up so it was
assumed that the pt aspirated.  That day she also spiked a
temperature to 100 so Flagyl was added for anaerobic coverage.
Vancomycin and Levaquin will be finished on [**4-20**] (14-day course)
and Flagyl's course will be complete on [**4-24**] (after 10 days).
.
4. Supraglottic edema
As above, pt was evaluated by interventional pulmonary after she
failed a passy-muir valve.  On bronchoscopy it was noted that
she had severe supraglottic edema with grabulation tissue and
the vocal cords could only be minimally visualized.  She was
taken to the OR two days later for a rigid bronchoscopy where
her granulation tissue was debrided and a t-tube was placed.
ENT evaluated the patient and recommended a CT of the trachea to
evaluate her anatomy.  The CT showed tracheal bronchomalacia and
narrowing of the glottic and subglottic airway.  Ideally, she
will get surgery by ENT to improve her subglottic edema when the
patient has recovered from her acute illnesses.
.
5. Anemia: Iron studies indicate anemia of chronic disease.
Pt's baseline hct is between 26 and 29 and except for the hct
drop after the bleed in the RUQ pocket, pt's hct remained
stable.
.
6. Multiple sclerosis
Pt started on oral baclofen prior to pump removal. She was
without signs of baclofen withdrawal (i.e. incr HR, temp, BP,
seizures) once pump was removed. She continued on Baclofen 20mg
qid po with an Ativan taper. PO baclofen was then tapered to
20mg tid.
.
7. Mental status
At baseline, although pt is significantly debilitated by MS, she
is alert, oriented, and conversant. Her decreased responsiveness
was thought to be [**1-8**] to meningitis, but although pt seemed to
have resolving temp and WBC with Abx, her diminished
reponsiveness persisted. Repeat LP in the unit suggested a
resolving meningitis.  Neurology was following the pt and
recommended an MRI to rule out stroke (esp given her ? of stroke
at OSH) an MRV to rule out sinus thrombosis and an EEG to rule
out subclinical seizures.  An EEG on HD #3 was consistent with
severe encephalopathy and an EEG on HD #6 was consistent with
meningoencephalitis with no evidence of seizures.  An MRI was
finally done on HD #10 and showed mild communicating
hydrocephalus, no evidence of cavernous thrombosis or stroke.
Towards the end of her unit stay pt opened eyes to name and
eventually returned to her baseline mental status.  Pt's mental
status remained at baseline and pt will follow-up with neurology
as an outpatient.
.
8. Respiratory status
After a supposed seizure at OSH pt was mechanically ventilated
thru her trach site b/c no breath sounds were appreciated. (At
baseline, pt has respiratory weakeness 2/2 to multiple sclerosis
but does not require mechical ventilation. Trach in place to
help with clearance of secretions.)  Pt placed on A/C in unit,
then transferred to CPAP and eventually placed on a trach mask
with good results.  At time of discharge, she was satting well
on 40% trach mask.
.
9. HTN
In unit, pt initially normotensive, then mid-way through stay
became hypertensive with SBPs in the 150-170s. Pt has hx of
hypertension. Unclear whether BP was rebounding from baclofen
d/c. BP became well-controlled with systolic BP in the 90s-110s
on standing doses of Lisinopril 20mg po, Metoprolol 25mg [**Hospital1 **].
.
10. Sacral decub ulcer: Stage 1-2.  Wound care nurse followed
while pt was in-house.
.
11. FEN: During pt's acute illness, she had an NGT placed.
Speech and swallow evaluated the pt and recommended thin liquids
and pureed food.  The following day, she was noted to have soup
coming out of her trach so she was again made NPO.  Pt then
passed the video swallow but again had some signs of aspiration
after trying some ground solids.  She was made NPO and GI placed
a PEG for feeding.  Pt should remain on tube feeds until her
tracheal swelling is much improved.  At that point, another
swallowing study can be performed and another trial of po
feeding.

Echo [**2198-11-26**]
Conclusions:
There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The
left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Resting regional wall
motion abnormalities include inferior and inferolateral
akinesis/hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a
trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

Compared with the report of the prior study (tape unavailable
for review) of
[**2193-4-18**], left ventricular dysfunction is new and mild aortic
regurgitation
is now detected.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 63 yo male with cardiac arrest [**3-7**] paroxysmal high degree
AV block, s/p collapse with PEA arrest now with temp pacer
transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt and permanent pacemaker
placement.
.
1. Rhythm: paroxysmal high degree block, temp pacer placed.
reasons for initial collapse are unclear, possibly combination
of high degree av block and electrolyte disturbances, since
patient was on many K+sparing diuretics.  Tele after admission
showed V-paced with few PVCs.  Pt underwent pacemaker placement
on [**2198-11-26**] without complications.  The next day device
interrigation was satisfacotory.  CXR did not show a
pneumothorax or any acute processes.  Pt remained without
complaints and was discharged on [**2198-11-27**].  Indications for
pacer was symptomatic with high degree block.
.
2. Coronaries: risk factors, [**Location (un) 47**] risk 17%, ruled out for
MI w/trop leak but flat CKs after arrest. -Cont ASA, BB, statin
- lipids checked : total chol 122, HDL 36, LDL 68.  Continued on
lipitor 20.
- initially held ACEI given [**Doctor First Name 48**] upto Creatinine of 2.2.  Given
his hyperkalemia on presentation pt was not restarted on ACE
inhibitors as his BP was well controlled.
- Repeat Echo (see below) showed EF of 50%.  Given this event
would recommend an outpatient evaluation by cardiologist for
likely exercise stress test.
.
3. Pump: EF [**2193**] was 60% w/LAE, likely diastolic dysfunction,
mild hypervolemia w/?mild pulm edema causing mild hypoxia,
initially gentle diuresis with goals -500cc to -1L.
- Continued amlodipine and metoprolol for rate control
- held ace/arbs due to [**Doctor First Name 48**]
- echo [**11-26**] showed EF of 50%.
- During the admission pt did not go onto complain any further
of Chest pain or Shortness of breath.
.
4. ARF/CRI: acute insult likely combo of triamterene and NSAIDS,
aggrevated by diuretics and ACE-I. Baseline 1.3-1.5 with
proteinuria long standing, should avoid NSAIDS for life.
-Discontinued ACE-I/ARBa and diuretics.
-Checked FeUrea, FeUrea: 36.5%, confirming ATN. spep and upep
(given anemia, pending), had u/s at [**Hospital1 46**] but should have
repeat as outpt to check complex cysts vs masses. Renal diet.
.
5. Anemia: new,  SPEP was negative, UPEP negative for bence
[**Doctor Last Name 49**] proteins,  and iron, shows anemia likely due to renal
causes
-PCP may consider [**Name9 (PRE) 50**] as outpt given pt's age and anemia.
.
6. Thombocytopenia: new, mild and stable during the admission.
.
7. Elevated glucose: possibly continued stress response, check
FS wnl.
.
8. h/o hypokalemia:  PCP may consider Nephrologist follow up.
Would Recommend outpt mineralocorticoid XS work-up once off K
sparing diuretics for a while.
.
9. Hip pain: awaiting THR. vicodin prn. No NSAIDs due to renal
problems.

Discharge Instructions:
You have had a pacemaker placed because of electrical block in
your heart. This may have been precipitated by kidney failure
and too much potassium in your blood. Do not take the
medications you were taking prior to this event. We have
enclosed a list of and prescriptions for your new medication
needs. Please take these as directed and discuss any changes
with your primary care doctor.
.
You have many risks for coronary heart disease. We feel you need
a stress test with imaging in the next month to make sure that
you do not have any significant need for a cardiac
catheterization. Until then, taking aspirin, your Toprol XL
(beta blocker safe in renal failure), your lipitor, and
eventually starting your lisinopril again will protect you
somewhat from heart attacks.
.
You must never take NSAID medications again. Your kidney disease
makes this dangerous. Avoid ibuprofen, advil, motrin, aleve,
naproxen, or ketoprofen. Talk with your doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 57**] if
you are unsure about any medications you are taking.


Followup Instructions:
1. See your primary care doctor Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 58**] on Friday 28th at
2:30pm, to check your potassium and creatinine levels and to
discuss everything we recommended. Have your doctor follow up on
the serum and urine protein electrophoresis that was pending
when you were discharged as well as the final report of your
echocardiogram. Talk with your doctor about your anemia and
whether or not you would need a bone marrow biopsy.

2. Go to the pacemaker DEVICE CLINIC Phone:[**Telephone/Fax (1) 59**]
Date/Time:[**2198-12-3**] 11:30

3. You should see our nephrologists sometime for your kidney
disease. Talk with your primary doctor about this and call for
an appointment [**Telephone/Fax (1) 60**].

4. You should also setup an appointment with a cardiologist to
have a exercise stress test done as outpatient.  You can speak
with your PCP regarding [**Name Initial (PRE) **] cardiologist or you can call [**Hospital 61**] at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 62**] to setup an appointment here.

Pertinent Results:
CT head:
Extensive bilateral subarachnoid hemorrhage. Recommend head CTA
to evaluate for an intracranial aneurysm.
Findings were discussed with Dr.

CTA:
FINDINGS: There is a 3 mm x 3 mm saccular outpouching from the
region of the anterior communicating artery (2:317), consistent
with aneurysm. This has a very narrow neck, and would be
amenable to endovascular intervention. No other aneurysm or
vascular abnormality is seen.
There is stenosis at the origin of the right vertebral artery.
Otherwise, the carotid and vertebral arteries and their major
branches are patent, with no evidence of stenosis or occlusion.
The distal cervical internal carotid arteries measure 5 mm on
the right, and 5 mm on the left.
Mild-to-moderate multilevel cervical spine degenerative changes
are noted.
IMPRESSION: 3 mm saccular aneurysm arising from the anterior
communicating
artery, with narrow neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 83**] was admited on [**2175-3-12**] and became increasingly
lethargic and transferred to the ICU for further care under the
Neurosurgery service. A diagnostic CTA revealed a large ACOM
aneursym which was coiled the following day.

Post Coiling the pt. was admitted to the ICU with a ventricular
drain. There were no incidences of increased intracranial
pressure or decline. A cerebral perfusion study performed [**3-15**]
confirmed the lack of vasospasm and develoing strokes.

He had some R shoulder weakness and shoulder X-ray was
concerning for rotator cuff injury and orthopedics was
consulted.

On [**2179-3-16**]/14/15 his ventricular drain was clamped and reopened
due to elevated ICP levels. On [**3-19**] he was transferred to the
SDU and continued to remain stable.  He had his ventricular
drain clamped on [**3-21**] and after 48 hours of the clamping trial
he had a CT done which was stable without any evidence of
hydrocephalus. At this time the drain was pulled.

He was placed on a fluid restriction for a brief period of time
for a drop in his Na level, and also on salt tabs, upon
discharge to rehab we have removed the fluid restriction, but we
are continuing the salt tabs, we advise that the Na level be
checked every other day, and the salt tabs may be d/c'ed when Na
is stable on serial checks. Upon discharge his Na is 138.

He is now ready for discharge to rehab.

On discharge his exam is as follows:

Alert and Oriented X2
Moving all extremities with full strength
slight Right Drift, which has been persistant throughout his
hospitalization, and possibly secondary to a rotator cuff
injury.

Pertinent Results:
CT head [**2199-1-22**]:
No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage or major cortical
territorial infarction.

CXR [**2199-1-22**]:
: New right lower lobe confluent opacity which may represent a
developing area of pneumonia. Differential diagnosis includes
aspiration and
atelectasis. Dedicated PA and lateral chest radiograph is
suggested for more
complete characterization when the patient's condition permits.

no contrast head CT [**2199-1-28**]
 FINDINGS: There has been interval development of an area of
decreased attenuation at the left basal ganglia and
periventricular white matter in the distribution of the left
lenticulostriate artery consistent with a subacute infarct.
There is associated swelling with mass effect on the left
lateral ventricle. There is no shift of normally midline
structures. Additional areas of hypodensity in the
periventricular white matter and right centrum semiovale are
unchanged and consistent with old infarctions. Two calcified
meningiomas are again seen arising at the left frontal dura and
anterior olfactory groove. They are unchanged from prior study.
No intracranial hemorrhage was identified. Surrounding osseous
and soft-tissue structures are unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: Subacute left lenticulostriate infarction which was
not present on head CT of [**2199-1-22**]

echo [**2199-1-28**]:

The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular  hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is
normal. Due to suboptimal  technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded.  Overall left
ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). There is a
severe resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Right
ventricular  chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The
aortic valve is not well  seen. There is probably mild aortic
valve stenosis. No aortic regurgitation is  seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity
of mitral  regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.]
There is a significant  left ventricular inflow gradient which
may be due to mitral annular  calcification and mitral valve
calcification. The tricuspid valve leaflets are  mildly
thickened. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.
There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

LENI [**2199-1-24**]:
No evidence of thrombus within the right upper extremity

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted with hypernatremia and acute mental status
changes and right sided paralysis. Her corrected sodium on
admission was about 170s and her free water deficit was 5.5L.
She was volume repleted with normal saline. She also recieved
D51/4 NS for free water repletion initially and this was changed
to free water boluses through nasogastric tube. Her sodium
gradually trended down with free water repletion. She also was
in pre-renal renal failure and her creatinine trended down with
hydration.

With regards to the acute mental changes, this is partially
explained by the hypernatrmic state. However, she was also noted
by the nursing home to have right sided weakness. CT head was
performed on admission which was negative for stoke. Neurology
was consulted and found that she has a MCA territory stroke by
exam. A repeat CT head was performed on [**1-28**] which showed
watershed infarct. TTE which was also obtained did not reveal
any thrombus.Per neurology recommendation, all her hypertensive
medication has been discontinued and she was started on aspirin.


Chest XRay on admission was concerning for right lower lobe
pneumonia. Her sputum culture grew MSSA for which she was on
oxacillin. Levofloxacin was also started for community acquired
pneumonia. Nasal aspirate was sent for influenza and was
negative. She was intubated on [**2199-1-24**] for increased respiratory
effort. Her resporatory decompensation was likely from
aspiration pneumonia. She was extubated on [**2199-1-31**] when her
lungs mechanic improved. However, given her  depressed mental
status and stroke, she was not able to clear her secretions
well. SHe was intubated again on [**2-2**] after unsuccessful attempt
to maintain her oxygen saturation with high flow mask. She
recieved tracheostomy and G tube and tolerated well post
procedure.

Her  nutrition status was maintained by tubefeeds and insulin
sliding scale and NPH kept her glucose within range.

Her blood pressure was initially low on admission. This
responded well to hydration and brief use of levophed. Her [**Last Name (un) 104**]
stimulation test was responsive. Admission EKG showed ST
depression in V2-V3 and it was unsure if this is old. She had
slightly elevated troponin, likely from acute renal failure
which eventually trending down.

Plastic surgery was consulted for decubitus ulcer. No
debridement was indicated and their recommendation was to
maxmize nutrition, wet to dry dressing and tight glucose
control.

She remained on sc heparin, lansoprazole, pneumoboots and bowel
regimen as part of her porphylaxis. She had picc line placed
upon discharge

THere had been multiple discussion with her daughter, which is
her health care proxy regarding code status. It was felt by the
medical team that her condition will not likely improve despite
optimal medical treatment. However, due to religious reasons,
her family remained steadfast that everything should be done.
However, her family agrees that should she go into cardiac
arrest, there should be no chest compression or defibrillation.

Pertinent Results:
Percutaneous coronary intervention, in [**4-/2174**]:
COMMENTS:
1. Limited coronary angiography demonstrated heavily calcified
left
main, left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. The
left circumflex had a heavily calcified proximal lesion.
2. LV ventriculography was deferred.
3. Successful Rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal left circumflex artery with a Cypher (3x13mm) drug
eluting stent postdilated to 3.5mm. Final angiography
demonstrated no
angiographically apparent dissection, no residual stenosis and
TIMI III flow throughout the vessel (See PTCA Comments).
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. One vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Successful rotational atherectomy, PTCA and stenting of the
proximal LCX with a drug eluting stent (Cypher).
.
.
2D-ECHOCARDIOGRAM performed on [**2174-5-20**] demonstrated:The left
atrium and right atrium are normal in cavity size. There is
moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal
cavity size and moderate global hypokinesis (LVEF = 30-35 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe aortic valve stenosis (area 0.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension. There is a very small circumferential pericardial
effusion.
IMPRESSION: Severe aortic valve stenosis. Moderate symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with moderate global hypokinesis.
Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension.

pericardial effusion without evidence of hemodynamic compromise
with a prominent anterior fat pad.
.
[**6-6**] EKG - Sinus tachycardia. Left atrial abnormality. Left
bundle-branch block.
Left axis deviation. Secondary repolarization abnormalities.
Compared to the
previous tracing of [**2174-6-4**] heart rate has increased. Otherwise,
no major
change.
.
CXRs over the course of admission showed slowly improving
pulmonary edema, no major focal consolidations were seen.
.
Renal US - no hydronephrosis, patent renal artery.

Brief Hospital Course:
# PUMP/Chronic systolic congestive heart failure:
Patient presented with presumed acute exacerbation of chronic
systolic heart, which has improved after ultrafiltration. [**Date Range **]
with EF of 30-40% unchanged from prior. She currently appears
fairly euvolemic, however her fluid status has remained
difficult to manage given her low ejection fraction and poor
urine output.
- Continued home doses of carvedilol and losartan.  Were held
initially for low blood pressures, but both restarted during her
admission.
- Hemodialysis was considered for fluid managment, but a trial
of lasix proved successful.  She will now go home on 160 mg PO
daily lasix and follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**], her nephrologist.
She will monitor daily weights/low sodium diet, pt had nutrition
consult during stay.
.
# CAD: No evidence ACS during hospitalization. Patient is s/p
recent LCx stent.  She was continued on ASA, carvedilol, plavix,
and Losartan.

.
#. Valves. No active issues. Severe AS a/p valvuloplasty
[**2174-5-11**], stable AS per [**Month/Day/Year **]. Discussed with patient and family:
per their report, patient was previously evaluated by Dr.
[**Name (NI) 137**] in cardiac surgery and was not a candidate for valve
replacment due to ""calcifications."" Patient may be candidate for
new cath-assisted valve replacement. Also has mild MR on last
[**Name (NI) 113**].  Pt should likely be re-evaluated after discharge.
.
# Respiratory distress resolved -
Respiratory distress was suspected to be likely multifactorial
secondary to volume overload and also PNA as supported by
elevated WBC on presentation, fever, and now GNR in sputum gram
stain but not growing on culture. Increased sputum overnight
while afebrile, non-elevated white count likely represents
resolving infection. Received monotherapy with ceftazadime only
given GNR in sputum may be pseudomonas; antibiotics started
[**5-29**], continued for 7 days.  She will continue lasix as
outpatient to try and prevent pulm edema.
.
# ANEMIA/GIB:
HCT drop was noted several two days into admission, unclear if
represented true blood loss. NGT removed [**5-31**] and this
demonstrated frank dark blood (+hemoccult) in NGT, likely
representing bleed several days ago from gastritis. LDH and
haptoglobin were checked with HCT drop and were within normal
limits which is inconsistent with hemolysis. She received 1 u
PRBCs soon after admission, and HCT has remained stable since.
Her Hcts were between 26 and 28.  Stools were checked for guiac,
and were positive two days prior to dicharge.  We discharged her
home with protonix and recommend follow up with her PCP to
continue to monitor CBCs for watch for blood loss.  She is not
actively losing blood as seen by her stable Hcts.  We also
recommend an outpatient colonoscopy.  Although, she needs to be
very careful with the bowel prep, as that can cause large fluid
shifts and drive her into pulmonary edema.
.
# Acute on chronic renal failure (stable Cr):
Acute on chronic renal failure likely due to ATN secondary to
hypotension versus ongoing pre-renal state. Patient had been
initiated on HD in [**2174-3-15**]; was taken off HD ~1 week prior to
admission. Volume overload/CHF on admission, improved with UF,
now appears euvolemic. Creatinine 1.... on discharge.  Pt has
history of RCC with nephrectomy.  Renal function has seemed to
normalize.  Will continue follow up with nephrologist and he
will also coordinate removal of dialysis catheter.

#  Pt was discharge to home with services for PT and home health
care for dialysis catheter dressing changes.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted for respiratory distress due to fluid in your
lungs from an acute episode of worsening heart failure.  You
were intubated at the time, and when you were able to breath on
your own, we continued to remove fluid from your lungs with
diuretics.  We also are continuing to give you the medicines
carvedilol and losartan for your heart failure.

You also will start taking lasix daily to ensure fluid stays off
your lungs.

In addition, you had acute renal failure during this admission.
Your kidney function improved, but you will continue to need
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].  You also have a dialysis catheter in
your chest that will need to be taken care of by a home nurse.
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will discuss removal of the catheter as an
outpatient.

We also found a trace amount of blood in your stool.  You should
meet with your PCP and discuss having a colonoscopy.  Make sure
to tell them you have heart failure because it does affect the
bowel preparation they plan for you.

Once at home, weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight >
3 lbs.
Adhere to 2 gm sodium diet.  Call the nutritionist with any
questions.

Also, if you experience any worsening shortness of breath, chest

Service:  Medicine [**Hospital1 139**]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old
female who has a past medical history significant for
coronary artery disease, hypertension, dementia, recurrent
pneumonia and recent gastrectomy for peptic ulcer disease,
who presented to the emergency room with a complaint of
increasing shortness of breath.  The patient had been at home
for approximately 2 days following discharge from rehab
following gastrectomy when shortness of breath developed.
Emergency medical services were called and the patient was
found to have an oxygen saturation of 65% on room air and 85%
on 100% non-re-breather.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypothyroid.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy for
perforated ulcer.
5.  Dementia.
6.  Esophageal motility disorder.
7.  Recurrent pneumonia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Living situation - the patient at baseline
resides at home with 24 hour home health assistance.  There
is extensive family involvement.  The patient's code status
is DNR, DNI.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Noncontributory.

ALLERGIES:  Sulfa.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Aricept 10 mg.
2.  Lasix 40 mg.
3.  Prevacid 30 mg.
4.  Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d.
5.  Multi-vitamin.
6.  Effexor 70 mg.
7.  Prednisone 25 mg.
8.  Zofran p.r.n.
9.  Synthroid 15 mg.

EXAM:  On presentation to the emergency department the
patient was found to have vital signs as follows:
Temperature 98.7, heart rate 82, blood pressure 160/62,
respiratory rate 25, oxygen saturation 87% on room air.  In
general, the patient is a well nourished but thin female in
respiratory distress.  There was no jugular venous distention
on examination of the neck.  Lung exam revealed decreased
breath sounds bilaterally.  Cardiovascular exam was
unremarkable.  The PEG site was clean, dry and intact.  The
patient was alert and oriented only to person.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  Admission CBC was unremarkable.
Admission SMA-7 was significant for an elevated BUN to
creatinine ratio consistent with dehydration.  Urinalysis was
unremarkable.  Cardiac enzymes were significant for an
isolated elevated troponin.  Coagulation studies were
unremarkable.  Arterial blood gas on 100% oxygen was
significant for a decreased pO2 of 70 and an elevated pCO2 of
59 with a normal pH.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray on admission revealed mild congestive
heart failure, markedly improved since the prior study of
[**2188-8-17**].  There was also bilateral lower lobe
opacification concerning for pneumonia.  CT angiogram
revealed consolidations at both lung bases consistent with
bibasilar pneumonia as well as subtle patchy opacifications
in the upper lobes with air fluid levels in the esophagus
suggesting possible aspiration.  There was no evidence of
pulmonary embolism.

CARDIAC STUDIES:  EKG on admission revealed sinus rhythm with
mild left axis deviation.  There was also felt to be possible
left anterior fascicular block.  The admitting MICU team
noted possible ST elevations in V3 through V6.
Echocardiogram revealed mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal left ventricular cavity size.
Overall left ventricular systolic function was normal.  There
was normal right ventricular systolic function.  There was
also moderate aortic regurgitation.  No pericardial effusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  Respiratory distress:  On admission, the patient was felt
to have bilateral pneumonia, most likely secondary to
aspiration.  The patient was started on IV Levaquin, Flagyl
and Vancomycin to cover for likely aspiration in a setting of
recent nursing home admission.  The patient was kept on
supplemental oxygen to keep oxygen saturations above 92% and
was kept NPO on aspirations precautions.  On day of admission
antibiotics were changed to IV ceftazidine, Flagyl and
Vancomycin.  Vancomycin was dosed at 1 gram q24 hours in the
setting of patient's decreased renal function, age and body
size.  On day two of admission the patient was also felt to
be fluid over loaded and gentle diuresis was resumed.  On day
two of admission the patient was felt to be stable for
transfer to the floor.  On the floor, the patient was
initially continued on IV antibiotics.  On day five of
admission the patient had a follow up chest x-ray which
revealed marked improvement in bibasilar pneumonia.  The
patient also had improvement in oxygen saturation and was
able to tolerate room air.  As a result, the patient was
transitioned to p.o. antibiotics and was given Augmentin and
Flagyl through the PEG tube.  The patient was discharged home
on hospital day 9 with instructions to complete a 14 day
course of p.o. antibiotics for presumed aspiration pneumonia.

2.  Cardiovascular:  Elevated troponin as well as possible ST
elevations on admission were felt to reflect a demand
ischemia.  Cardiac enzymes and EKG changes stabilized.  The
patient was continued on aspirin, Lopressor throughout the
admission.  On day three of admission the patient had an
episode of sinus tachycardia likely secondary to dehydration
versus multi-focal atrial tachycardia secondary to pulmonary
disease.  This resolved following hydration.  The patient's
cardiovascular function remained stable for the rest of the
admission.

3.  Dementia:  The patient was continued on Aricept
throughout the admission.

4.  Gastrointestinal:  Following rehydration, the patient was
found to have a mildly decreased hematocrit.  As a result,
the patient was received an elevation by gastroenterology to
look for gastrointestinal bleeding as an etiology of
decreased hematocrit.  Given the patient's history of peptic
ulcer disease, gastroenterology service recommended H. pylori
serology, which was negative.  Iron studies were sent, which
revealed a decreased total iron binding capacity as well as
decreased iron suggestive of a combination of both blood loss
and chronic disease as etiologies of anemia.
Gastroenterology service felt, however, that EGD and
colonoscopy were not an option in setting of patient's recent
ischemic cardiac disease.  Furthermore, the patient refused
gastroenterology work up.  Gastroenterology service also
asked to evaluate patient for possible contribution of reflux
of jejunostomy tube feedings to development of aspiration
pneumonia.  Gastroenterology service felt that reflux of
J-tube feedings was unlikely, however, felt that patient's
long history of esophageal dysmotility could be contributing
to aspiration.  They recommended swallowing study.  The
patient received an oropharyngeal video fluoroscopic
swallowing evaluation on day five of admission.  This
revealed mild oral with moderate to severe pharyngoesophageal
dysphagia with significant impaired upper esophageal
sphincter opening leading to severe residue of solids in the
pharynx.  However, there was no aspiration.  Nevertheless,
swallowing service recommended the patient in future have
only thin liquids, pureed solids or very finely/minced meat
in p.o. diet.  They also recommended that the patient sit
bolt upright at meals and for 45 minutes after meals.  They
recommended the patient remain at 45 degrees in bed at all
times and should never lay flat in bed and recommended that
if patient must remain flat in bed that tube feedings be
discontinued for 30 minutes prior to patient laying flat in
bed.

5.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on Levothyroxine
for hypothyroidism.

6.  GU:  The patient was placed on Foley catheter on
admission to the hospital.  On day seven of admission the
patient was ready for discharge from a medical standpoint,
but did not void in time status post discontinuation of the
Foley catheter.  As a result the patient remained in-house
for an additional day to ensure the patient could void
spontaneously following discontinuation of Foley catheter.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Metronidazole 500 mg q8 hours x7
days, Augmentin 500/125 mg p.o. b.i.d. x7 days, furosemide 40
mg p.o. q.d., aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., metoprolol 25 mg p.o.
b.i.d., Venlafaxine HCL 75 mg capsule p.o. q.d.,
Levothyroxine 150 mcg p.o. q.d., donepezile hydrochloride 10
mg p.o. q.h.s., Lansoprazole 30 mg q.d., iron sulfate 325 mg
p.o. q.d., multi-vitamin.

DISPOSITION:  To home with visiting nurse as well as 24 hour
home health assistance.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  On day of discharge, the patient was
ambulating, voiding spontaneously and had oxygen saturation
of 97% on two liters.  The patient was demented in a manner
consistent with baseline.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Aspiration pneumonia.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Peptic ulcer disease status post gastrectomy.
5.  Hypothyroidism.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 61-year-old male with
a past medical history significant for right upper lobe small
cell cancer stage III, status post chemotherapy and
radiation, status post right upper lobe sleeve resection
[**6-19**], also with past medical history significant for diabetes
mellitus, hypertension, prostate cancer status post radical
prostatectomy, GERD, TIA 15 years ago, gout and COPD. The
patient has no known drug allergies.  The patient is status
post right upper lobe lung sleeve resection on [**6-19**] for small
cell lung cancer.  The patient was discharged home doing well
until four days prior to admission when he presented to the
Emergency Room with shortness of breath and fevers.  The
patient was given Levaquin and was then discharged home
again.  He continued having shortness of breath and
productive cough.  He was admitted [**7-11**] for a follow-up
bronchoscopy during which time they found a right middle lobe
obstruction secondary to swelling.  After the procedure the
patient had shortness of breath with an oxygen saturation of
88 as well as rigors and chills.  The patient was also found
to have poor color.  The patient's O2 saturation improved.
Chest x-ray was obtained and the patient was admitted.  The
patient underwent surgery [**2175-7-15**].  The patient underwent
completion pneumonectomy, bronchoscopy and serratus flap
closure of right main stem bronchus.

pending.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to administer
Lasix today after transfer to the floor.  Infectious disease
came by to see the patient postop day #2 as well because they
were requested to recommend an antibiotic for the right
infiltrate to prevent the possibility of a postoperative
empyema.  Their recommendation was to continue with the
current IV antibiotics.  Clindamycin and Ceftriaxone will be
present. In the remote chance of postoperative infection
empyema these antibiotics will be present in the cavity and
also by peripheral circulation.

Postoperative day #3, events over the last 24 hours include

.5, glucose 141.  Physical exam was benign.  Plan was to
check the PT, PTT and to get a chest x-ray today and to
continue 20 mg of Lasix.  ID came by to see the patient again
today at which time they stated that the patient is already
on broad coverage for the lung abscess.  Strep and staff
improving, the tubes will be discontinued after the

emboli in the left lung, patient on Heparin.  ID again came
by to see the patient at which time they stated that the
patient was clinically stable from an ID perspective and to
continue the antibiotic regimen for a total of 14 days.  If
the patient spikes a fever they were to be consulted again.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 61 year old man
with a history of stage III squamous lung carcinoma, status
post lobectomy and pneumonectomy on the right earlier this
year, who was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] for respiratory failure.  Two weeks prior to
admission, the patient began experiencing episodes of
shortness of breath, cough and dyspnea.  Echocardiogram and
electrocardiogram performed at that time were reportedly
unremarkable.

On [**2175-9-17**], after coming home from his son's wedding, the
patient became acutely short of breath, agitated and
collapsed on the floor, stating that he could not breathe.
His family called 911 and the patient was intubated in the
field and taken to [**Hospital 189**] Hospital where a chest x-ray was
reportedly normal but electrocardiogram showed transient new
left bundle branch block, ST elevations in leads II through
V4 and Q waves in the anterior precordial leads, all of which
was new.  He was transferred to the [**Hospital1 190**] and Coronary Care Unit for further evaluation
and management.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy, chemotherapy and radiation.
2.  Transient ischemic attack.
3.  Pulmonary embolism.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, on Amiodarone.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.
7.  Negative exercise Thallium test in [**2175-2-26**].

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
3.  Oxazepam p.r.n.

5.  Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Neurontin 100 mg p.o. t.i.d.
7.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient has a sister who died of cancer
at the age of 39, and an older brother status post coronary
artery bypass graft.  His father also had coronary artery
disease and a sister has cardiac valve disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient quit smoking three months ago
following three to four packs per day times forty years.  He
consumed two to three drinks per day.  He is a construction
worker.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On admission, temperature is 99, heart
rate 70 to 80s, blood pressure 110/60, oxygen saturation 95%.
In general, the patient was intubated and sedated.  Head,
eyes, ears, nose and throat examination indicated the pupils
2.0 millimeters and reactive bilaterally.  Endotracheal tube
is in place.  Cardiovascular - tachycardia with no murmurs,
rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary examination - The patient had
diffuse coarse rhonchi on the left and absent breath sounds
on the right.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended
with normal bowel sounds.  The extremities were warm with 1+
distal pulses.

LABORATORY DATA:  Initial laboratory studies at the outside
hospital indicated that he had a white blood cell count of
11.4, hematocrit 41.0, platelets 466,000.  The differential
on the white blood cell count was 74% polys, 15% lymphocytes,
and 8% monocytes.  Chem7 indicated a sodium of 136, potassium
5.0, chloride 96, bicarbonate 35, blood urea nitrogen 12,
creatinine 1.3, glucose 285.  Prothrombin time was 22.4,
partial thromboplastin time 37.4, INR 3.0.  Arterial blood
gases indicated a pH of 7.29, paCO2 of 54, paO2 of 506 on a
100% FIO2.  Urinalysis was within normal limits.  CKs were 41
and 57 with a troponin of 0.04 and then 0.6.

Chest x-ray indicated status post right pneumonectomy with no
infiltrate and mild vascular engorgement.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Coronary
Care Unit where he later ruled in for myocardial infarction
with a peak troponin of 4.5 and flat CKs.  A Transesophageal
echocardiogram indicated an ejection fraction of 25% and
apical hypokinesis.  The patient was also noted to develop
new onset rapid atrial fibrillation with associated
hypotension and was cardioverted to normal sinus rhythm but
remained hypotensive requiring pressors.  A CT angiogram was
performed to rule out pulmonary embolism, which was negative.

On [**2175-9-19**], a PA catheter was inserted which indicated
decreased central venous pressure and decreased pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure consistent with septic shock.  The
patient concurrently developed a temperature to 100 to 101
while urine culture grew E. coli.  The patient was started on
intravenous Levofloxacin, Vancomycin and Tobramycin and
transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he
received intravenous fluids and was changed from Levophed to
vasopressin with good effect.  On [**2175-9-21**], the pressors were
weaned.

Bronchoscopy was performed which indicated intact suture
sites with some thick secretions.  On [**2175-9-22**], the patient
was successfully extubated.  Over the weekend of [**2175-9-23**],
and [**2175-9-24**], the patient defervesced with decreasing white
blood count and was successfully switched to oral medications
with stable blood pressure.  His antibiotics other than
Levaquin were discontinued.  The patient was then transferred
to the C-Medicine service for workup of coronary artery
disease.

Cardiac catheterization indicated 30% mid right coronary
artery stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex arteries with a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60%.  The patient was
titrated up on a beta blocker ace inhibitor.  Lipid panel
indicated a total cholesterol of 201, triglycerides of 137,
LDL of 133 and HDL of 41.  He was therefore started on statin
therapy for hypercholesterolemia.

The patient was worked up for anemia with hematocrit in the
30.0s during his stay in the C-Medicine service and was found
to have an iron of 22, ferritin of 459, TIBC of 228,
transferrin of 175. These findings were consistent with
anemia of chronic disease and thought secondary to his lung
cancer.

On the C-Medicine service, the patient was noted to have
bilateral carotid bruits.  Carotid Doppler studies were
performed which indicated less than 40% bilateral stenosis
and mild plaquing bilaterally.

The patient was maintained on Heparin during his hospital
course and started on Coumadin two days prior to anticipated
discharge with plan to discharge to home on Lovenox until the
patient reached a therapeutic INR of 2.0 to 3.0.

From an endocrine perspective, the patient was treated with
regular insulin sliding scale for his diabetes mellitus with
a plan to transition back to his home regimen of Glyburide 5
mg p.o. q.d.  Fingerstick blood sugar indicated good glycemic
control during hospital course.

A physical therapy consultation was arranged and at the time
of discharge dictation, it was anticipated that the patient
would be deemed safe for discharge to home with outpatient
physical therapy follow-up.

At the time of dictation, the patient was planned to be
discharged to home with VNA.  He was also to follow-up in [**Hospital 191**]
Clinic for an INR check on the day following discharge and
was to follow-up with his primary care physician in [**Name9 (PRE) 191**] firm.
He was to complete a fourteen day course of Levaquin, which
had been switched to p.o. on the day prior to his discharge
in order to treat his urinary tract infection.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Urosepsis.
2.  Acute myocardial infarction, status post cardiac
catheterization indicating 30% mid right coronary artery
stenosis and mild irregularities in the left anterior
descending and left circumflex.
3.  Stage III-A squamous cell lung carcinoma, status post
right pneumonectomy.
4.  Atrial fibrillation, status post cardioversion to normal
sinus rhythm.
5.  Prostate cancer, status post radical prostatectomy.
6.  Diabetes mellitus.

DISPOSITION:  On discharge, it is anticipated at the time of
dictation that the patient will be discharged to home with
VNA and will require outpatient physical therapy.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric Coated Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2.  Levaquin 500 mg p.o. q.d. for a total course of fourteen
days.
3.  Coumadin 3 mg p.o. q.h.s.
4.  Amiodarone 400 mg p.o. b.i.d.
5.  Atenolol 25 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Lisinopril 2.5 mg p.o. q.d.
7.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
8.  Percocet one to two tablets p.o. q4-6hours p.r.n.
9.  Ambien 10 mg p.o. q.h.s.
10. Oxygen four liters nasal cannula.
11. Lovenox 80 mg subcutaneous b.i.d. until INR is greater
than 2.0.
12. Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizer treatments q4hours
p.r.n.
13. Glyburide 5 mg p.o. q.d.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Much improved.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62 year-old
male with a past medical history of squamous cell lung cancer
treated with right total pneumonectomy, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease on 2 to 3 liters of home oxygen with
saturations in the low 90s at baseline, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes mellitus type 2 who was recently
admitted from [**7-15**] to [**2176-7-19**] for presumed
bronchitis or bronchiectasis flare here with recurrent cough,
shortness of breath and fevers.  During his last admission
two weeks ago he was treated for chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease flare versus bronchitis with a ten day
Prednisone taper and Augmentin for one week.  He underwent
bronchoscopy due to concern for possible endobronchial
lesion, which was normal.  Sputum sample was done at that
time showed no growth.  He was discharged at his baseline
function on [**2176-7-19**].  The plan was to treat him for one
week of Augmentin, skip one week followed by Bactrim for one
week, skip one week and then on Augmentin for two weeks for
pneumonia prophylaxis.  The last dose of Augmentin was
[**2176-7-22**] after being on Augmentin for only three days.

He was doing well until approximately one week ago when he
developed mild spasms in the afternoon that he thought was
due to low potassium.  Within the following days he
complained of worsening cough productive of clear sputum.  He
had a low grade temperature, mild headache and worsening
cough and presented to the Emergency Department.  He denied
any sinus pain, sore throat, chest pain, abdominal pain,
diarrhea, dysuria or joint pain.  In the Emergency Department
he was febrile to 102 orally and had a heart rate of 160 and
a blood pressure of 118/56.  Respiratory rate 28.  Sating 88
to 98% on 100% nonrebreather.  Initially he was stable, but
then had a gradual change in mental status with hypoxia,
which resulted in his elective intubation.  He received Lasix
100 mg intravenous twice, 1 mg of Bumex and 1 gram of
Ceftriaxone as well as 125 mg of Solu-Medrol.  He was also
placed on a heparin drip for a subtherapeutic INR and given
morphine and Ativan for sedation.  Chest x-ray showed no
focal pneumonia or evidence of heart failure.  The patient
then underwent a CT angiogram of the chest that showed no
evidence of pulmonary embolism.

was stopped and he was continued on Azithromycin.  He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospital stay
and his white blood cell count decreased daily.  On hospital
day two he was stable for extubation and tolerated extubation
very well.  He was then transferred on hospital day number
three out of the Intensive Care Unit to the medical floor.
He continued to improve clinically with a decrease in his
fever curve and decrease in his oxygen requirements.  He also
subjectively improved and on his last hospital day he was
comfortable and ambulating without oxygen.  He stated that he
had come back to his baseline.  White blood cell count
returned to [**Location 213**] range, and cultures were negative except
for one anaerobic bottle that was growing gram positive
coxae that had been unidentified by the time of discharge.

2.  Pulmonary:  This was treated as possible
tracheobronchitis versus chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease versus atypical pneumonia.  The patient was kept on
his usual inhaler and nebulizing medications as well as
Azithromycin and intravenous Solu-Medrol.  After hospital day
number two and the patient was extubated and improving the
Solu-Medrol was switched to Prednisone and was rapidly
tapered.  The patient was encouraged to ambulate and was
given regular respiratory treatment and chest physical
therapy.  By the end of the hospitalization the patient felt
that he had returned to his baseline lung function, baseline
pulmonary function and was coughing up less dark sputum.  To
manage his congestive heart failure Lasix was used
judiciously in order to gently diurese him over the course of
the hospitalization followed by urine output and daily
weights.  The patient responded to this well and felt overall
that his symptoms of volume overload had improved.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Based on his presentation, it was not
clear that there was not a cardiac component causing his
change in his status, so cardiac enzymes were sent.  Three
sets of enzymes were negative and showed no evidence of
myocardial infarction.  He had a number of electrocardiograms
that were checked to ensure that he did not have a
significantly prolonged QTC interval and that it was not
worse.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was followed with blood glucose
measurements that showed that his glucose was under poor
control with the Glyburide and the regular insulin sliding
scale.  As the regular insulin sliding scale was increased
and the Prednisone was tapered these values returned closer
to normal.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Improved.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  1.  Humibid LA 600 mg b.i.d.  2.
Lasix 160 mg b.i.d.  3.  Potassium 40 milliequivalents po

this was arranged on an outpatient basis, with chest physical
therapy and incentive spirometry and other pulmonary
treatments.  The plan was that he would follow up with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] in clinic the following week and that he would have
an INR drawn on [**8-6**] calling the results to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Respiratory distress.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 62-year-old
male with a past medical history significant for lung cancer
status post right pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], six
hospitalizations since [**2176-5-27**], last discharged on
[**2176-8-4**], with the diagnosis of tracheal bronchitis
versus chronic obstructive pulmonary disease flare, versus
atypical pneumonia, status post intubation in the MICU,
chronic secretions/congestion-related problems, on
alternating regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim since [**2175-9-28**] for multiple bronchitic-like infections, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure,
atrial fibrillation, prior PEs, diabetes type 2, status post
myocardial infarction, who presented with gradual shortness
of breath beginning on the day of admission.

The patient reported a [**1-29**] day history of general fatigue.
On the day of admission, visiting nurse services reported a
systolic blood pressure of 70.  The wife drove the patient to
the Emergency Room.  The patient also complained of some
dizziness, however denied other symptoms including fever,
chills, sweats, chest pain, diarrhea, constipation, nausea,
vomiting, or urinary symptoms.  He reported good p.o. intake
and appetite.

The patient reported that he has a chronic, slight cough,
however, denied any sputum production.  He took his oral
temperature at home and denied any fever.  At home, the
patient is on oxygen of [**12-31**] L via nasal cannula.  The patient
recently finished a steroid taper on [**8-14**] which was
two weeks in length.  He reported a usual SBP of 80-110.  The
patient did note that since [**Month (only) 216**], a Scopolamine patch was
added to his regimen and has increased his secretions
significantly.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Per Emergency Room, the patient
appeared close to intubation upon presentation and was placed
on 100% oxygen via non-rebreather with an ABG of 7.46, pCO2
of 48, and pO2 of 33.  There was a question if this was a
venous gas or not.  Lasix 100 mg IV, Albuterol nebs,
Solu-Medrol 600 mg IV, and Ceftriaxone 1 g IV was given to
the patient.  When evaluated by the MICU shortly after
arrival to the Emergency Room, the patient was weaned down to
baseline of 2 L oxygen with oxygen saturation of 100% via
nasal cannula.  The patient was breathing comfortably at
18-20 breaths/min.  The patient no longer complained of
shortness of breath but did state that he felt slightly
tired.  Chest x-ray was negative, and a CT showed no acute
PE.  The patient reported that he was back to baseline in the
Emergency Room.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Stage III squamous cell lung
cancer diagnosis in [**2175-2-26**], status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-6-28**], with radiation, Carboplatin,
and Taxol treatments.  2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease with PFTs in [**2176-5-27**] showing an FEV1 of 0.83 L,
which is 25% of predicted, and FEV1 to FVC ration of 68% of
predicted.  3.  Congestive heart failure with preserved left
ventricular function in [**2176-5-27**].  4.  Atrial fibrillation.
This was noted perioperatively.  5.  Prostate carcinoma
diagnosed in [**2172-2-26**] status post radical prostatectomy in
[**2172-8-27**].  6.  Diabetes type 2.  7.  History of
urosepsis.  8.  History of PE during the patient's
postoperative course in [**2175-6-28**].  9.  Status post
myocardial infarction.  This was also perioperative in [**2175-6-28**].  Catheterization at that time showed normal left
ventricular function, ejection fraction of 50%, and a 30%
right coronary artery lesion.  10.  Status post transient
ischemic attack in [**2165**].  11.  Gout.  12.  Gastroesophageal
reflux disease.  13.  Sleep apnea.  14.  Colonic polyps noted

mg q.h.s.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with wife and quit smoking
in [**2175-5-28**].  He smoked 3-4 packs per day for 40 years.  No
alcohol abuse.  He is a retired construction worker.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Sister died at age 39 of cancer.  Brother is
status post coronary artery bypass grafting.  Father with
history of coronary artery disease.  Sister with heart valve
disease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 98.5??????, heart
rate 70, blood pressure 89-122/60-77, respirations 19-20,
oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L nasal cannula.  General:  The
patient was in no apparent respiratory distress.  He was
comfortable.  He was alert and awake.  HEENT:  Pupils equal,
round and reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Moist mucous
membranes.  Oropharynx clear.  Cardiovascular:  Regular, rate
and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  Distant heart sounds.
Without murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Lungs:  Loud rhonchi
throughout the left lung field.  No apparent wheezing or
rubs.  Transmitted sounds to right side.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended.  No hepatosplenomegaly.
Extremities:  Without clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 10.4, hematocrit 30.0, which is
baseline, platelet count 388; CHEM7 was unremarkable; PT
22.5, PTT 31.3, INR 3.5; B12 327, folate 12.7.

Electrocardiogram unchanged from prior.  Theophylline level
4.3.

Chest x-ray showed status post right pneumonectomy, left lung
with no congestive heart failure, no pneumonia, no
pneumothorax, no effusion.  CT angiogram showed no acute PE,
possible chronic PE in pulmonary artery segment in the left
lower lobe that is not occlusive.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This was a 62-year-old male with a past
medical history of lung carcinoma status post right
pneumonectomy, multiple recent hospitalizations since [**Month (only) 205**]
for bronchitic-like infections, on chronic alternating
antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim, recent
hospitalization in MICU with intubation, chronic secretions,
and congestive-related problems, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, on home oxygen, congestive heart failure,
prior PEs, history of atrial fibrillation, who presented with
respiratory distress.

1.  Respiratory distress:  The patient was given Lasix,
Albuterol nebs, and Solu-Medrol in the Emergency Department
and had rapid improvement of his symptoms.  It was thought
that the patient's acute respiratory distress was most likely
secondary to mucous plugging.  PE was ruled out by CTA.
Chest x-ray showed no clear signs of congestive heart failure
or pneumonia.  The patient also recently completed a steroid
taper for possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
component and was not clearly bronchospastic during this
admission.  He had no cough and no sputum production and no
fevers.  The patient was rapidly tapered off of steroids, as
it was thought that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was
unlikely to be the cause of his acute respiratory distress
and because it was unclear whether steroids was really
benefitting this patient.

He continued to have aggressive chest physical therapy for
secretion management and was continued on his Scopolamine
patch, Serevent, Combivent, Atrovent/Albuterol nebs, and
inhalers.  He was also continued on his alternating
prophylactic antibiotic regimen of Augmentin and Bactrim.  He
continued to do well and recorded oxygen saturations of
greater than 92%.  On the day of discharge, oxygen saturation
was 97% on room air.

Of note, the patient was observed in the MICU overnight but
was discharged to the floor quickly and had no other episodes
of respiratory distress.

2.  Hypotension:  The visiting nurse noted a systolic blood
pressure of 70; however, by the time the patient came to the
Emergency Room, he had an SBP of 90.  It was thought that the
patient's slightly decreased SBP was secondary to
hypovolemia.  He was given gentle fluid hydration.  He also
had a cortical stimulation test to assess for renal
insufficiency given that he had just finished his steroid
taper; however, this was done after Solu-Medrol had been
given to the patient.  It was reportedly negative, but it was
unclear as to how accurate this is in the setting of recent
Solu-Medrol dosing.  His Lasix was decreased from 160 mg
b.i.d. to 80 mg b.i.d., and his ACE inhibitor was
discontinued.  He continued to remain normovolemic during the
rest of his hospitalization.

3.  Cardiovascular:  In terms of the patient's history of
perioperative myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, and
congestive heart failure, the patient was continued on his
Amiodarone and Lasix 80 mg b.i.d.   He also continued Aspirin
and Lipitor.  His electrocardiogram was unchanged, and it was
thought that there was not any significant cardiac component
to the patient's respiratory distress.

4.  Endocrine:  The patient was continued on his Glyburide
and was covered with an Insulin sliding scale in the
hospital.

5.  History of pulmonary embolus:  The patient was continued
on his Coumadin while in-house.  No further work-up was done.

6.  CODE STATUS:  THE PATIENT IS FULL CODE.

DISPOSITION:  He will be discharged to pulmonary
rehabilitation to try to maximize his pulmonary status.  He
appears to be doing very well with physical therapy during
this hospitalization and has slightly improved his exercise
tolerance.  He will also be started on a Morphine Elixir 5-10
mg sublingually p.r.n. q.6 hours for shortness of breath to
relieve the patient's symptom of air hunger.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
2.  Mucous plugging.
3.  Congestive heart failure.
4.  Hypotension.
5.  Diabetes type 2.
6.  History of pulmonary embolus on Coumadin therapy.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient will be discharged to
pulmonary rehabilitation.

FOLLOW-UP:  He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 217**] and his
primary care physician [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 63 year old
male with a past medical history of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, lung cancer, status post right
pneumonectomy in [**2175-1-26**], complicated by pulmonary artery
laceration, status post transtracheal catheter placement for
oxygen and suctioning who was in his usual state of health
until [**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower
abdominal pain, and projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.
He presented to the [**Hospital6 256**]
Emergency Room on [**2177-11-25**].  At that time he denied
diarrhea, constipation, fevers, chills, hematochezia and
bright red blood per rectum.  He had dark stools at baseline
secondary to iron use.  The stool was found to be guaiac
positive in the Emergency Department.  In the Emergency
Department also his hematocrit value was 19, down from a
baseline of 31 one month previously and he was coagulopathic
with an INR of 9.8.  Attempts to place a nasogastric tube in
the Emergency Department were unsuccessful.  While in the
Emergency Department, he was transfused 4 units of packed red
blood cells, 2 units of fresh frozen plasma, and got 2 mg of
subcutaneous Vitamin K.  The patient was admitted to the
Medicine Floor.  Repeat hematocrit several hours later
dropped to a value of 13.  The nasogastric tube was placed on
the floor with nasogastric lavage negative for fresh blood.
He was, at that point, transferred to the Medical Intensive
Care Unit.  Workup while in the Medical Intensive Care Unit
included two esophagogastroduodenoscopies, both without fresh
blood or old blood but demonstrating a single raised 5 to 7
cm esophageal nodule on an erythematous base at approximately
25 cm.  There was no evidence of stigmata of recent bleeding.
He was stabilized with a total of seven units of packed red
blood cells, seven units of fresh frozen plasma and one unit
of platelets.  He also received intravenous fluid
resuscitation with normal saline.  Computerized tomography
scan of the abdomen was performed which was negative for
diverticuli, perforation or retroperitoneal bleed.
Colonoscopy performed later in the hospital course showed
some polyps, diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon and
descending colon.  Internal hemorrhoids were noted but no
stigmata of recent bleeding.  The patient's coagulopathy was
improving.  His hematocrit was stable, and he was transferred
to the General Medicine Floor on [**2177-11-28**].  Of note,
prior to transfer he developed swelling of the right upper
extremity and complained of pain of the right upper
extremity.  Doppler ultrasound was performed which showed
evidence of a right axillary deep vein thrombosis.

pulmonary process.  Abdominal x-ray demonstrated
opacification of the right lung base.  The left lung base was
clear.  There was no free air in the abdomen.  There was a
large amount of fecal material in the right colon.  There was
a normal bowel gas pattern.  There was no evidence of
obstruction.  Later computerized tomography scan of the
abdomen and pelvis demonstrated no intra-abdominal abscess,
bowel inflammation, evidence of perforated ulcer,
appendicitis or diverticulitis.  Electrocardiogram showed
normal sinus rhythm at 93 beats/minute, normal axis,
prolonged QT interval, no left ventricular hypertrophy, T
wave inversions were noted in leads V1 and V2 which were new.
No acute ST elevations or depressions noted.  This was
compared with the prior electrocardiogram from [**2177-10-9**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  In summary, this is a 63 year old male with
past medical history of chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, lung cancer status post right pneumonectomy in
[**2175-1-26**] complicated by a pulmonary artery laceration,
status post transtracheal catheter placement for oxygen and
suctioning.  He was in his usual state of health until
[**2177-11-24**] when he developed nausea, lower abdominal
pain, projectile vomiting of nonbloody emesis.  His
hematocrit dropped from 31 to a nadir of 13.  His
gastrointestinal workup was unrevealing in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit.

1.  Anemia secondary to acute blood loss - The patient's
gastrointestinal workup included two
esophagogastroduodenoscopies and colonoscopy times one
without source of frank bleed.  However, in light of his
initial complaints of nausea, abdominal pain, and guaiac
positive stool a gastrointestinal source was still suspected.
Physically the small bowel could be the source.  After
stabilization in the Medical Intensive Care Unit with blood
products, fresh frozen plasma and platelets, he was
transferred to the Medicine Floor after having stable
hematocrit for greater than 24 hours.  While on the floor,
his hematocrit was checked initially every 12 hours.  After
demonstrating stability for a total of 72 hours it was spaced
out to q. day hematocrit checks.  All told the patient
received 7 units of packed red blood cells, 7 units of fresh
frozen plasma and one unit of platelets during his hospital
stay.  On [**2177-12-3**], the patient underwent repeat
esophagogastroduodenoscopy in order to obtain biopsy samples
of the esophageal nodule, not noted on previous study.  At
the time of this dictation results of those biopsies were
pending.  While in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the
patient also had workup for hemolysis to evaluate whether
hemolysis could be attributing to his anemia.  He had a
normal left ventricular hypertrophy, haptoglobin and
bilirubin on admission, however, making hemolysis a very
unlikely explanation for his presentation hematocrit of 19.
Moreover, no schistocytes were seen on peripheral smear.
Hemolysis laboratory data were checked several days into his
hospital course and were consistent with changes status post
large volume transfusion with no evidence of active ongoing
hemolysis.

2.  Right upper extremity deep vein thrombosis - On [**2177-11-28**] the patient began to complain of right upper
extremity pain and swelling.  Doppler ultrasound demonstrated
an axillary deep vein thrombosis.  In light of his recent
bleeding episode, anticoagulation was held initially.
Although upper extremity deep vein thromboses do not embolize
as often as lower extremity deep vein thromboses, there was
still a very high concern for pulmonary embolus in light of
the patient's history of right pneumonectomy and the
functionality of his one remaining lung.  The computerized
tomography scan was performed to better examine the right
upper extremity soft tissues.  In particular there was
concern that the patient might have an obstructing mass
lesion or fibrosis-post his pneumonectomy that could be
contributing to venous stasis and obstruction leading to deep
vein thrombosis formation.  Computerized tomographic venogram
was without evidence of obstructing lesion of fibrosis,
however.  The patient is likely hypercoagulable as evidenced
by the development of this right upper extremity deep vein
thrombosis spontaneously after being off anticoagulation in
the setting of his acute bleed for only several days, there
was concern for recurrent deep vein thromboses.  Therefore,
an inferior vena cava filter was placed on [**2177-12-2**].
The patient tolerated the procedure well.  On [**2177-12-4**], the patient then began to complain of pain and swelling
of the right lower extremity.  Examination was consistent
with possible thrombus of the right lower extremity.
However, as the patient already had an inferior vena cava
filter placed and delineation of a right lower extremity deep
vein thrombosis would not change management plans at all, the
decision was made not to undergo ultrasound doppler imaging
of the right lower extremity.  In light of his probable
hypercoagulability, decision was made to reinitiate
anticoagulation with the Coumadin.  His Coumadin level will
be followed by his outpatient physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
His INR should be checked remotely at the rehabilitation
facility and his Coumadin dose adjusted accordingly for a
goal INR of 2 to 3.

3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease/lung carcinoma
status post right pneumonectomy - The patient was continued
on aggressive regimen of chest physical therapy and pulmonary
toilet.  He was continued on his outpatient medicines,
Combivent, Salmeterol, and Theophylline.  He was continued on
antibiotic prophylaxis with Bactrim Double Strength in light
of his history of bronchiectasis.  He was monitored for acute
decompensation and his respiratory status, particularly
concerning for pulmonary embolism in light of his right upper
extremity deep vein thrombosis.  He continued to improve from
a respiratory standpoint.  He was diuresed gently after
arriving to the Medicine Floor status post fluid
resuscitation and blood product administration in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit in the setting of his acute bleed.  With
the diuresis, pulmonary toilet and supportive care, his
respiratory status improved somewhat.  However, he is not
back to his baseline of 2 liters of oxygen nasal cannula at
home.  At the time of discharge he was maintaining
saturations in the 97 to 100% range on 4 liters but he
continued to complain of increased dyspnea with activity and
shortness of breath, occasionally at rest.  It was felt that
a lot the patient's dyspnea was secondary to muscle
deconditioning due to his prolonged illness and hospital
stay.  Therefore he will be discharged to a pulmonary
rehabilitation program in hopes of increasing his
conditioning and improving his overall pulmonary status.

4.  Diabetes mellitus 2 - The patient was maintained on a
diabetic diet, with q.i.d. fingersticks, fingerstick blood
glucose testing and coverage with a regular insulin sliding
scale.  He was maintained on his outpatient dose of Neurontin
for neuropathy.

5.  Atrial fibrillation - He was continued on his outpatient
dose of Amiodarone.  Of note, he is currently in sinus
rhythm.

6.  Acute renal failure - The patient on admission had an
elevated creatinine level above his baseline.  This was
likely secondary to prerenal causes, specifically hypovolemia
and intravascular volume depletion in the setting of his
acute bleeding episode.  His acute renal failure resolved
after fluid hydration.

7.  Vitamin B12 deficiency - The patient was continued on his
outpatient regimen of supplementation with Vitamin B12, 1000
mcg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Hypercholesterolemia - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.

9.  Depression/anxiety - The patient was continued on his
outpatient dose of Paroxetine 20 mg p.o. q.d.

10.  Fluids, electrolytes and nutrition - The patient was fed
a diabetic heart-healthy diet.  He received supplementation
with multivitamins and Vitamin B12.  Electrolytes were
aggressively repleted.  At the time of discharge he was
tolerating regular diet without nausea, vomiting or other
incident.

DISPOSITION:  With the patient's general deconditioning as
well as his pulmonary status being slightly below his
baseline I felt that he would benefit from an inpatient
pulmonary rehabilitation program.  He will be discharged to
such a program.

149, CK 96, troponin 0.06.

EKG with sinus rhythm at 94 with normal axis; poor baseline;
no other ST-T wave changes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  This is a 63-year-old man with multiple
medical problems who was recently admitted with severe anemia
and likely lower gastrointestinal bleed who had multiple
polypectomies in the ascending and transverse colon on
[**2178-1-15**] and represented with lower abdominal pain and
bright red blood per rectum and anemia.

1.  Gastrointestinal bleed and blood loss anemia:  Most
likely secondary to complication from recent colonoscopy and
polypectomy.  Patient had a negative EGD and then had a
colonoscopy which did show a bleeding vessel at the site of
previous polypectomy.  This was clipped with two clips with
good control of the bleeding.

Patient's hematocrit remained stable.  He did receive a total
of four units of packed red blood cells on this admission.
After colonoscopy with clipping, no further melena or bright
red blood per rectum was noted.  Patient's hematocrits were
followed serially and remained in the 26, 27 range and
eventually was transfused the fourth unit day prior to
discharge, but his hematocrit remained 29 and 31 on day of
discharge.

Otherwise, symptomatically much improved and slowly advanced
his diet from liquids to soft mechanical diet, which he
tolerated well with no further episodes of melena or bright
red blood per rectum.

Patient was initially started on Protonix 40 intravenously
b.i.d. as his EGD was negative.  Eventually was switched back
to his 40 p.o. q. day regimen which he continued even as an
outpatient for his gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Patient's blood pressure remained stable after transfused
with blood.  He also had a negative tagged red cell scan and
negative EGD.  Eventually, after colonoscopy, had a small
bowel follow through to rule out any source of blood loss as
in his previous admission.  This was also negative.  Patient
could not have a Meckel scan during this stay because of
barium and can have it at least one week after barium
ingestion.

Because of the recent colonoscopy and the bleed, patient's
Lovenox dose and Coumadin dose were continued to be held.
Patient's anticoagulation, including aspirin, Coumadin, and
Lovenox, were to be held for at least one week and can be
restarted on [**2178-1-27**] per GI.

2.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:  Patient's
respiratory status was stable and at baseline.  Continued his
home regimen of Advair, Combivent, and Theophylline and
p.r.n. nebulizers as needed, although his pulmonary exam
remained stable and he was at his baseline home oxygen of 2
liters and will be discharged on the same regimen.

3.  Status post lung cancer, status post pneumonectomy:  Was
stable with tracheostomy.  Continued b.i.d. suctioning with
good results.  Continue the Scopolamine patch for
antiemetics.

4.  Prostate cancer:  He does have recently rising PSA most
recently 8.9 in 02/[**2177**].  Patient was eventually able to have
a bone scan during the course of his stay which was negative
for metastases, only positive for previous post surgical bony
changes.  Patient will be followed up with urologist, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 261**], in terms of his prostate cancer follow up.

5.  Troponin leak:  This was attributed to demand ischemia.
He had negative EKG changes, and he had a catheterization in
[**1-/2175**] which revealed 30% mid lesion but no flow-limiting
disease.  His enzymes remained stable through the course of
his stay and was attributed to his anemia.  Patient's aspirin
was held because of the bleeding and can be restarted
[**2178-1-27**].  Patient was continued on his statin.

6.  Atrial fibrillation:  Patient was in sinus rhythm
throughout the course of his stay and was stable on
Amiodarone.  Again, his Coumadin was held for concerns with
bleeding.

7.  Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolus:  He has a
history of [**Location (un) 260**] filter and right upper and right lower
extremity deep venous thrombosis.  His hypercoagulable state
is likely attributed to the prostate cancer, but otherwise
his Coumadin was held for the bleeding reasons, and patient
did have increasing amounts of swelling of his right upper
and right lower extremity.

Patient was taken off his Lasix dose through the course of
the stay because of concern for hemodynamic instability.  Was
given p.r.n. doses of Lasix throughout the stay and continued
to elevate his extremities with good results of them.

Patient did have both upper and lower extremity ultrasounds
done to rule out new deep venous thrombosis.  The right lower
extremity ultrasound was negative.  The right upper extremity
did show the old known thrombus in the right basilic vein but
no progression or change from previous studies, and this
otherwise was stable throughout the course of his stay.

8.  Diabetes:  He has fairly good control with hemoglobin A1C
most recently at 6.0.  He was continued on his home regimen
of Glyburide once he was taking p.o. and covered with sliding
scale as needed.

For his neuropathy patient was continued on his Tylenol
Number 3 and was discharged with a prescription for Morphine
sulfate per his request, although he was not continued on
this during the course of his stay.

9.  Gout:  This was stable throughout the course of his
admission, but patient was continued on his home dose of
Colchicine.

Brief Hospital Course:

1) Respiratory distress: Improved with face mask. Serial ABGs
showed hypercarbic failure, improved with face mask. Switched to
nasal cannula in PM [**11-18**], but ABGs with ongoing hypercarbia in
the 80s. At night, patient had sub-acute worsening respiratory
status, with desaturation and tachypnea, along with agitation
and confusion. pH with PCO2 in 90s. Placed on CPAP,
unsuccessfully. Repeat ABG with PaCO2 87, pH 7.29. Patient
intubated. Arterial line finally placed successfully. Extubated
on [**11-19**] but extremely anxious and hypertensive and hypercarbic.
Placed on BIPAP and reintubated. [**2178-11-23**] trach placed.  Pt was
stable with the trach and venitilator support.  Pt has been
maintaining stable oxygenation and ventilation on pressure
controlled ventilation with PS 3, PEEP 5, Fi02 0.5, PIP 22, TV
500-600, RR18.
He benefited from albuterol/atrovent nebs, suction, steroids. At
the time of discharge he was on day 4 of prednisone taper.  Pt
was also on Zosyn for GNR, has h/o pseudomonas. No further abx
at the time of discharge.

2) [**Name (NI) 283**] Pt was placed on amiodarone for afib, but this was
discontinued when he developed persistent bradycardia to the
30's-40's on [**2177-11-29**]. Pt was also anticoagulated on a heparin
drip and on [**11-24**] began coumadin loading.

3)bradycardia- likely [**12-30**] amiodarone; resolved after holding
this med ([**2178-11-30**]). pt will follow up with Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 284**] and will
likely need a Holter Monitor as an outpt. TFT's pending at time
of discharge.

4) agitation: likely due to hypercarbic reso drive, controlled
with haldol and then resolved completely when respiratory status
stabilized.

5) DM: controlled on RISS with standing dose of NPH.

6) FEN: [**Last Name (STitle) 282**] tube placed on [**2177-11-29**] without complication.
Tubefeeds started through the [**Date Range 282**] on [**2177-11-30**].

Brief Hospital Course:
64 year-old male with history of lung cancer post-right
pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Year/Month/Day 282**] placement and
antibiotic course for pneumonia, now returns from [**Hospital **] rehab
with diarrhea, stage IV sacral decubitus ulcer, and sepsis. No
source of infection had been identified so far. He was C-diff
negative, blood/urine/sputum culture had not yield any organism.
He was treated empirically with ceftazidime, vancomycin and
metronidazole for 7 days. His blood pressure responded to fluid
challenge and he has been normotensive since then. He was
started on stress dose steroid which was weaned off. He was
gradually weaned off ventilation and tolerated trach mask well.

His blood sugar was well controlled with glargine and sliding
scale. He was also noted to have decubitus ulcer. Plastic
surgery was consulted and felt that debridement was not
necessary. Therefore, he was cotinued on wet to dry dressing,
Kinair bed and his nutrition was optimized. He remiained in
normal sinus rhythm and is on coumadin for history of atrial
fibrillation.

He was very agitated in the ICU. He was weaned off fentanyl drip
and put on fentanyl patch. He also was put on standing zyprexa
and prn haldol, morphine. He was also on standing valium and was
actually thought to be in benzo withdrawal as his wife claims
that he was on valium at home.He is full code and his health
care proxy is his wife.

.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 64 yo man s/p lung ca s/p pneumonectomy and severe COPD
here after prolonged admission for respiratory failure requiring
tracheostomy placement here with new left sided chest pain.
.
1. Chest pain: Multiple sets of cardiac enzymes were cycled and
CK/MB remained flat while troponin increased slightly and then
remained stable at 0.12.  Repeat EKGs showed no changes.
Cardiology was consulted and agreed that there was no evidence
of an acute ischemic event.  Pt was continued on ASA.  The pt's
chest pain may be related to his chronic SVC syndrome.
.
2. Respiratory Failure: Pt on a prolonged ventilator wean
secondary to COPD, pneumonectomy, lung cancer and hx of
recurrent pneumonias.  Pt was continued on AC at night and
pressure support during the day.  He will continued to wean at
rehab.
.
3. Bilateral upper extremety swelling: This has been chronic
since last admission w/o evidence of DVT.  Pt had another CTA in
the ER that showed no PE but did show a narrowing of the SVC.
Interventional radiology placed a stent in the SVC and over the
next several days, the pt's upper ext swelling improved.
.
4. Atrial fibrillation: Pt remained in normal sinus rhythm for
most of the hospital stay except for a brief episode of a fib
with rapid ventricular rate which resolved on its own.  Pt was
continued on his coumadin.
.
5. Anxiety: Pt has a long history of anxiety controlled on
fentanyl, morphine prn, haldol. AVOID benzos as pt has
paradoxical response.
*
6. Anemia: Likely secondary to chronic disease- baseline around
28.  Iron studies were sent and revealed a low iron with normal
TIBC, ferritin.  He was transfused once to [**Last Name (un) 291**] hct>30.
.
7. DM type 2: Pt's glucose was controlled with glargine and an
insulin sliding scale.
.
8. Access: A PICC line was placed by IR when pt was having his
SVC stented.  If this line is not needed, it should be pulled to
decrease infection risk.  It was placed on [**2179-2-4**].

Brief Hospital Course:
65yo man with many medical problems p/w hypotension in the
setting of rapid aitral flutter. Also with a Urinary Tract
Infection.

Assessment/Plan: 64 year-old male w/ history of lung ca s/p
right pneumonectomy, severe COPD, recent trach and [**Month/Day/Year 282**] [**Hospital **]
rehab with a flutter 2:1, leukocytosis, hypotension and UTI.
.
1. Hypotension:  [**Month (only) 116**] have been due to infection from UTI vs.
symptomatic tachycardia.
Responded to aggresive fluid resusciation and rate control.
Remained normotensive for the rest of hospitalization. Of note,
his blood pressures were lower in left arm and family reported
that this is a [**Last Name 294**] problem for him.
.
2. Atrial Flutter: He has a known history of paroxysmal Atrial
Fibrillation.His was initially in rapid Atrial Fluuter with 2:1
conduction. This initially responded to diltiazem. On hopital
day #2 he went back into artial flutter and in consultation with
Electrophysiology service Amiodarone was initiated and diltiazem
was stopped (as he had been on Amiodarone for 3.5 years in the
past, and it had to be discontinued [**10-31**] due to bradycardia
when lopressor was added).  He remained in sinus rhythm for the
remainder of the hospitalization. Plan is continue Amiodarone
400mg TID x 1 week then 400mg [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week then 200mg po QD
thereafter.  He is to avoid beta blockers and calcium channel
blockers.

3. Respiratory Failure:  His chest x-ray showed no evidence of
Pneumonia. Due to a notable trach leak, his trach was changed by
respiraotory. An interventional Pulmonolgy consult was obtained
due to concern of cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff
leak to prevent further tracheamalacia-- he would be willing to
change the trach to a foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the
future if the cuff leak is interfering with the ability to
ventilate.  He was continued on PS as tolerated with periods of
rest on Assist Control.
.
4. Klebsiella Urinary Tract Infection: He was initally started
on ceftriaxone which was changed to levofloxacin but given
history of heart block to levo, he was changed to Bactrim to
complete a 7-day course for complicated UTI. The Urine Culture
grew Klebsiella which is sensitive to Bactrim.His foley catheter
was discontinued.
.
5.Acute Blood Loss Anemia: His baseline hematocrit was 28-30. He
was initially hemo-concentrated, but then on hospital day #3,
his hematorcit dropped to 19.  due to extensive bleeding from
site of central line, he was transfused 2 UPRBC and had an
appropriate bump in his hematocrit. He was noted to have [**Known lastname **]
guaiac positive stool, but this was in the setting of extensive
bleeding from Internal Jugular catheter site into his
trach/mouth. His hematocrit should be followed as an outpatient,
and his stools should be continued to check guauic studies for
trace blood.
.
6. Bleeding from Central Line site. He is maintained on coumadin
for Atrial Fibrillation and his inital INR was therapeutic.
After IJ placement, he had continued oozing from IJ site leading
to anemia with hct 19.   He was given FFP and vitamin K (0.5 mg
iv) to reverse his coagultopathy. He should be restarted on
coumadin for Atrial Fibrillation at rehab.
.
5. Diabetes Mellitis: He was continued on glargine and regular
insulin sliding scale. His sugars were in good control.
.
6. Pain/anxiety/depression:
He was continued on his outpatient doses of Fentanyl
75mcg/q72hours, Haldol for anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg
tid/prn, and paxil.   His pain is from his scaral decubitus
ulcer.
.
7. Sacral Decubitus: He was seen by wound care nurse and
continued on DSD for sacral wound.
.
8. Left Upper Extremity Swelling: He had U/S which showed...
.
9. Diastolic Congestive Heart Failure: He was given lasix prn to
keep fluid even.
.
10.Code: FULL
.
11. Dispo: Discharged to [**Hospital **] Rehab.
.
12. Access: The Right Internal Jugular Vein triple lumen
catheter was not discontinued per [**Hospital1 296**] request. This was
placed on [**2179-3-21**].
------
Outstanding issues on discharge:
1.The pt was started on coumadin at 5 mg qday on day of
discharge [**3-26**].  Please monitor his INR and adjust dose
accordingly.
2.The pt has a swollen L arm and had U/S on day of discharge to
r/o clot. No read has been given yet. Please call [**Hospital1 18**] to
follow this up. Regardless, he is being restarted on
anticoagulation which would be treatment of choice.

History of Present Illness:
65 year-old gentleman with multiple medical problem including
history of lung cancer post right pneumonectomy in [**2174**], severe
COPD, post tracheostomy and [**Year (4 digits) 282**] placement(respiratory failure
due to pneumonia) recently admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] for urosepsis, now
presenting yet again with hypotension and altered mental status.

Patient unable to give a history at this time so obtained from
records. Pt was admitted to [**Hospital1 **] on [**3-26**] after an admission
at [**Hospital1 18**] for a Klebsiella UTI and hypotension. Since his
admission there, the pt has been alert and getting out of bed to
the commode with assistance. On [**4-11**], the pt became lethargic
and then gradually unresponsive. On [**4-12**], his BP decreased to
60 over palp and the pt was noted to be diaphoretic. He received
a 500 cc bolus with an increase in his BP to 90/40. He remained
unresponsive during this time. ABG showed 7.265/92.7/82 on an
FiO2 of 0.50 with a temperature of 99.4. Of note, pt's triple
lumen was placed [**2179-3-21**].
.
Wife later arrived at the hospital and was able to provide
additional history. She reports that he had been doing very well
until Friday. They were working on weaning him and he was able
to be on the trach mask for 1-2 hours at a time. However, on
Friday, the pt felt mildly more SOB per his report. He was
maintained exclusively on the vent over the rest of the weekend.
Yesterday, the pt's wife reports that he looked ""very scared""
and would often stare at the ceiling. He also had periods of his
eyes ""rolling back in his head"". He was occasionally responsive
to her. She reports that they had been checking ABGs over the
last 24 hours and his CO2 had been elevated. When they changed
the vent settings to decrease the CO2, she felt that he was
slightly less confused. She also notes that he was very
diaphoretic yesterday and his faced appeared red and swollen.
The pt's BP has always been very low in his left arm and she
reports that they just starting taking his pressure there due to
a skin tear on the right.
.
In the ED, the pt's VS were, 99.8 85 80/60-L 150/80-R 20 100% AC
400/20/100%/PEEP 5. He received vancomyicin and zosyn. Pt was
initially started on levophed for hypotension. However, after
learning that his BP has always been considered to be abnormally
low in the left arm, it was checked in the right and has been
stable in the 120s off of pressors. No new consolidation on CXR.
Normal lactate.

studies:
ECG- Sinus rhythm at 72 beats per minute. Nonspecific ST-T wave
changes but no major changes since previous studies.
.
CXR- Stent projecting over the right brachiocephalic vein. Right
lung remains opacified with shift of the cardiac and mediastinal
contours toward the right consistent with previous
pneumonectomy. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle
which could represent pleural thickening or small left pleural
effusion. Slightly increased interstitial markings int he left
lung which appear stable. No new left pneumo or focal
consolidation.
.
Head CT (WET READ)- No hemorrhage, shift, mass effect, or
evidence of hydrocephalus. No evidence of a major CVA.

US upper extremity:IMPRESSION:
1) Nonocclusive thrombus in the left cephalic vein.
2) Nonocclusive thrombus in the distal left brachial veins

Transabdominal ultrasound examination was performed. The
gallbladder is not distended. There is an 8-9 mm stone located
at the neck of the gallbladder. The gallbladder wall is
thickened. There are possible crystal or tiny cholesterol polyps
located at the fundus of the gallbladder. No intra or
extrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation is identified. The common
duct is not dilated and measures 3 mm. Flow in the portal vein
is anterograde. Limited evaluation of the liver demonstrates no
focal abnormality.

IMPRESSION: Thickened gallbladder wall with a stone in the
gallbladder neck in a nondistended gallbladder. In the proper
clinical setting, these findings may be consistent with
cholecystitis. They are not completely typical for acute
cholecystitis. Gallbladder wall thickening may also be produced
by third spacing of fluids. If there is continued clinical
concern for cholecystitis, a HIDA scan may be performed for
further evaluation.

TECHNIQUE: CT images of the chest without the administration of
IV contrast.

COMPARISON: [**2176-9-11**] and [**2179-3-21**].

FINDINGS:
Soft tissue window images demonstrate changes of prior right
pneumonectomy and mediastinal shift towards the right. There is
no pathologic axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
There is a left pleural effusion. The patient is intubated with
a tracheostomy tube. A stent is again identified within the
right brachiocephalic vein. The heart demonstrates coronary
calcifications, but is normal in size. The main pulmonary artery
appears prominent measuring 3.5 cm.

Lung window images demonstrate multifocal nodular opacities seen
scattered throughout the left lung. No specific areas of
cavitation are identified within these nodules. Atelectasis is
also seen at the left lung base. There is no focal consolidation
or pneumothorax. Septal thickening is seen throughout the left
lung field. A small 3-mm nodule seen on the prior studies is
again seen, though slightly difficult to discern given the
surrounding septal thickening and nodular opacities. However, on
the study from [**2179-3-21**], this nodule was clearly seen and appears
stable dating back to [**2176-9-11**]. The bronchi appear patent to the
segmental level within the left lung.

Images of the upper abdomen demonstrate high-density material
within dependent portion of the gallbladder, probably relating
to sludge. A percutaneous gastrostomy tube is seen within the
stomach. The remainder of the visualized portion of the upper
abdomen is unremarkable other than arterial calcifications. The
soft tissues are unremarkable. Degenerative changes are seen
throughout the thoracic spine.

IMPRESSION:
1) Multifocal nodular opacities seen scattered throughout the
entire left lung. These most likely represent aspiration
pneumonia. Septic emboli are considered less likely based on the
CT appearance.
2) Mild CHF.
3) Left upper lobe nodule seen on the prior study of [**2179-3-21**]
demonstrates stability dating back to [**2176-9-11**].
4) Probable sludge within the gallbladder.
5) Findings suggestive of underlying pulmonary arterial
hypertension.


Brief Hospital Course:
65 y/o man with PMH significant for squamous cell lung CA, type
2 DM, atrial fib, and multiple past pneumonias admitted from
[**Hospital1 **] with mental status change and hypotension.

#ID/sepsis
Patient had fever and leukocytosis initially with fluctuating
blood pressure, lactate 1.3. His blood pressure in the ED was
measured on the left arm (which is typically much lower). His
blood pressure on the right was found to be normal and pressors
were off. Sputum culture was sent(colonized with pseudomonas),
blood culture, urine culture and cath tip culture negative on
discharge. His decubitus ulcer looks clean. His line was resited
line to the right femoral. Chest CT was consistent with
aspiration pneumonia. He will be continued on zosyn for 14 days.
He remained afebrile and no pressors required throughout the
rest of his hospital stay.

#Mental status changes:
His mental status improved with decreasing CO2 and also with
narcan. His CO2 remained well controlled in the hospital and was
at baseline in 70s. CT head was negative. Narcotics was taken
into consideration as possible cause of mental status changes.
Patient's duragesic patch was removed in the ED.

#anemia/coagulation
Patient has history of deep venous thrombosis with IVC filter
and SVC clot and also atrial fibrillation for which he was on
coumadin. COumadin was taken off 3 days prior to hospital
admission because he had blood oozing from his trach and foley.
In hospital, central line was attempted intially on the right
subclavian but the artery was puctured. His right femoral artery
was also punctured and he did lose a signifcant amount of blood.
The 2 arterial puncture was tamponaded and there was no
hematoma. He also got an ultrasound of uppper extremity which
revealed DVT in left arm for which he was started on heparin
drip. He then had mild guiac negative stool and oozing from
arterial line site. Heparin drip was then stopped and he was
given 2 unit of transfusion. His hematocrit had been stable
since then. On discharge, coumadin was not restarted. It should
be restarted in 1-2days time if the hematocrit remain stable.
.
#transaminitis
He presented intially with transaminitis likely from
hypotension. LFTS trended down on discharge. RUQ ultrasound was
done which showed gallstone at neck of GB, no distension,
thickened gallbladder. He remained afebrile and has no abdominal
tenderness

#respiratory:
Patient has squamous cell lung CA post right pneumonectomy and
post tracheostomy. During his past admission there was concern
about cuff leak and possible tracheomalacia. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
recommended keeping the cuff pressures low with a cuff leak to
prevent further tracheamalacia. Possible change the trach to a
foam-filled trach ([**Last Name (un) 295**] tube) in the future if the cuff leak
is interfering with the ability to ventilate. He remained on
assist control ventilation.
.
# [**Name (NI) 300**] Pt with mildly elevated Na at 148. This is most
likely due to water deficit as he can not drink to replace his
needs. He recieved free water through G tube.
.
# Cardiac
Patient has long history of atypical chest pain but has no such
complain during this hospitalization. Cardiac enzymes were
unremarkable. He was continued on aspirin and also amiodarone
for atrial fibrillation. He is to avoid beta blockers and
calcium channel blockers because of profound bradycardia.
.
#Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Patient was continued on standing 8U glargine and sliding scale
while in hospital.

#Anxiety/pain
Patient's family reports that he is extemely anxious at
baseline. He was continues on his outpatient doses of Haldol for
anxiety 5mg hs, 2mg 8am/2pm, 1mg tid/prn, and paxil. His pain is
from his scaral decubitus ulcer and back pain. Anxiety has been
severely worsened in the past with ativan. Would avoid further
ativan. Fentanyl patch was discontinued since there was a
concern regarding narcotic overdose. He was on prn morphine.
THis should be adjusted in [**Hospital1 **].

# Sacral Decubitus:
He had Kinair bed

# FEN
Tube feeds was continued with no residual

#access
He had picc line on discharge

#code
OK with pressor, do not resuscitate(confirmed again with family
meeting)

[**2119-5-16**] Upper GI : In this patient status post gastric bypass and
partial gastrectomy with repair
of marginal ulcer, there is free flow of contrast through the
gastric pouch and the gastrojejunostomy. No leak or holdup of
contrast identified in this study.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 303**] was admitted to the hospital and examined by the
Bariatric service. He had no abdominal pain but had Dilaudid
prior to his transfer.  His cardiac work up was negative and due
to the finding of pneumoperitoneum on abd CT he was taken to the
Operating Room for an exploratory laparotomy. He had a
perforated marginal ulcer and underwent a partial gastrectomy,
omental patch to ulcer and a cholecystectomy. He tolerated the
procedure well and returned to the ICU in stable condition.
His pain was controlled with a Dilaudid PCA and he remained
hemodynamically stable.
He was subsequently transferred to the Surgical floor for
further management.

Due to his recent surgery and length of time prior to taking
fluids he had a PICC line placed for TPN which began on [**2119-5-14**]
through a right AC PICC line.  This was continued until [**2119-5-18**].
In the interim he had an upper GI on [**2119-5-16**] which showed no
anastomotic leak and he gradually began a stage 1 diet.  This
was slowly advanced over the next 24 hours to stage 3 and he had
no trouble with nausea or fullness.

His abdominal wound was healing well and he was up and walking
independently.  He remained free of any pulmonary complications
post op by using his incentive spirometer.  Roxicet was
effective in treating his incisional pain and he was generally
improving every day.

After an uncomplicated course he was discharged to home on
[**2119-5-18**] and will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in 2 weeks.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is an 84-year-old
female with a past medical history significant for Parkinson
disease with associated [**Last Name (un) 309**] body dementia and a long history
of tobacco abuse who was noted with fevers.

The patient was in her usual state of health until two weeks
prior to admission when she developed rhinorrhea.  The
patient and her daughter deny any other symptoms at that
time.

However, on the evening of [**2109-3-12**] the patient
reports that she developed pain in the right side of her
neck.  The following day, she had a temperature to 101 with
continued intermittent right-sided neck pain.  She was again
febrile on the morning of admission and called her primary
care physician for his advise.  He suggested that she report
to the Emergency Department for further evaluation.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's vital signs
revealed a temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit, her heart
rate was 75, her blood pressure was 93/46, her respiratory
rate was 18, and her oxygen saturation was 96% on room air.

A chest x-ray in the Emergency Department showed consistent
cardiomegaly.  An opacity in the right lower lobe with
probable right pleural effusion was identified.  There was no
pneumothorax.  The patient was started on levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  Blood cultures were
obtained.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on
admission revealed the patient's temperature was 98.8 degrees
Fahrenheit, her blood pressure was 128/70, her heart rate was
74, her respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation
was 95% on room air.  In general, alert and oriented.  She
was in no acute distress.  She was able to talk in complete
sentences comfortably without shortness of breath.  There was
an occasional cough.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat
examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.  The
pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.  The patient
was edentulous.  The mucous membranes were very dry.  No
lesion in the oropharynx.  The neck was supple.  There was no
tenderness to palpation.  There was no lymphadenopathy.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and

bacteria.  Urine culture was pending.  Blood culture was
pending.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  Within the first few days of her
admission, the patient was treated with levofloxacin for a
presumed community-acquired pneumonia.  However, despite
antibiotic treatment, the patient's white blood cell count
remained elevated in the low 20s.  It did trend down slightly
during this time period.

Throughout the first few days of her admission, the patient
denied any shortness of breath and had an oxygen saturation
in the mid 90s on room air.

On [**2109-3-18**], a posterior/anterior and lateral chest
x-ray was obtained to re-evaluate the patient's presumed
pneumonia.  In comparison to the admission film, the right
lower lobe opacity had increased in size and intensity.
There was a probable right pleural effusion.  There was also
slightly more prominent pulmonary vessels on the right which
were considered to be positional.  The left lung was
relatively clear at that time with minor atelectasis at the
base.

The following day (on [**2109-3-19**]), a chest computed
tomography was obtained to better visualize the patient's
lungs.  This showed a right loculated pleural effusion with
parietal pleural enhancement and several small gas
reflections.  In addition, there was right lower lobe
atelectasis and consolidation and left upper lobe
ground-glass opacities consistent with a second infectious
process.

At this time, a Pulmonary Service consultation was obtained.
Antibiotics were changed to vancomycin and ceftazidime.  The
patient was taken to Interventional Pulmonary for placement
of a chest tube on the right to drain the loculated effusion.
Following placement of the chest tube, the patient had a
small amount of hemoptysis in Interventional Pulmonology.  In
addition, her oxygen saturation dropped to 88% on 3 liters
via nasal cannula.  The patient was placed on 100%
nonrebreather with an increase in oxygen saturations to 96%.
At that time, the patient was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit for further care.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient's oxygen requirement
rapidly decreased.  However, the chest tube did not drain the
pleural fluid as expected.  It was found to not be in a
sufficient pocket of pleural fluid.  Cardiothoracic Surgery
was consulted, but the patient and her family wished to avoid
surgery at that time.

Therefore, on [**2109-3-22**], the patient was called out
to the floor for further treatment with antibiotics.  Her
chest tube was removed.  The patient was treated broadly with
ceftazidime, vancomycin, and metronidazole.

A long discussion was held with the patient and her family
regarding the slim possibility of cure of her loculated
infection with antibiotics alone.  However, they continued to
desire to avoid invasive procedures.  They were willing for a
pigtail catheter to be placed in Interventional Radiology to
see if it could drain some of her pleural effusion, and this
was done on [**2109-3-23**].  Fluid continued to drain from
the pigtail catheter over the next several days.  During this
time, the patient's white blood cell count remained elevated
but she was afebrile and had good oxygen saturations on room
air.

However, despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and drainage from
the pigtail catheter, the patient's white blood cell count
was still significantly elevated on [**2109-3-28**] at
22,000.  At that time, the family spoke to the Cardiac
Surgery and decided to proceed with a video-assisted thoracic
surgery.  The patient underwent the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure on [**2109-3-29**].  Following the
procedure, she was initially extubated.  However, in the
Recovery Unit, the patient developed hypotension to a
systolic blood pressure in the 70s requiring treatment with
Neo-Synephrine, acute respiratory distress with desaturations
to the low 90s on face mask, and was eventually reintubated
and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for
further management.

The patient was successfully extubated in the Medical
Intensive Care Unit the next day (on [**2109-3-31**]).  The
patient was returned to the General Medical floor later that
day and has done well since that time.  At the time of this
dictation, the patient was saturating in the mid to high 90s
on room air.  In addition, her white blood cell count
continued to decrease following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure.  On [**2109-4-2**] her white blood cell
count was 11.5.  Her chest tube was removed on [**2109-4-1**] without difficulty.

An infectious and cytologic workup had been pursued on the
fluid drained through the chest tube and pigtail catheter.
In addition, specimens were sent during the video-assisted
thoracic surgery procedure.  At the time of this dictation,
the fluid obtained on [**2109-3-22**] grew scant
gram-positive rods.  All other cultures have been negative to
date.  Cytology specimens were negative for malignant cells.
Final report of pleural tissue pathology was still pending.

2.  NECK PAIN ISSUES:  A wide differential was considered on
admission for the patient's right-sided neck pain.  The
patient had the neck pain only she was spiking fevers.  It
was not reproducible on examination.

Two days into the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course, her neck pain
resolved spontaneously and has not returned.

3.  HYPERTENSION ISSUES:  On admission, the patient was
continued on her home dose of lisinopril with good blood
pressure control.  Following the video-assisted thoracic
surgery procedure, the patient became hypotensive in the
Recovery Unit and required pressors.  However, her blood
pressure quickly returned to a normal range.  She was
re-initiated on lisinopril 5 mg by mouth once per day on
[**2109-4-2**].

4.  DEPRESSION ISSUES:  The patient was continued on
sertraline throughout her hospital course.

5.  PARKINSON DISEASE WITH [**Last Name (un) **] BODY DEMENTIA ISSUES:  This
was stable throughout the [**Hospital 228**] hospital course.  The
patient does not take any medications for this condition.

6.  REHABILITATION ISSUES:  Physical Therapy worked with the
patient as tolerated during her admission.

7.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient was
maintained on a low-sodium diet.  Her potassium and magnesium
were repleted as needed.

8.  PROPHYLAXIS ISSUES:  The patient was maintained on
subcutaneous heparin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis.
Pantoprazole for gastrointestinal prophylaxis.  Senna and
Colace for a bowel regimen.  The patient was placed on a
nicotine patch during her admission to avoid withdrawal given
her long smoking history.

9.  CODE STATUS ISSUES:  At this time, the patient is do not
resuscitate/do not intubate.  Her family is very involved in
the medical decision making.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was to be discharged to
[**Hospital6 310**].  She is currently saturating
in the mid 90s on room air.  She was afebrile, and her white
blood cell count was trending down.  The patient reported
that she felt well.

.
## GI bleed: Pt's hematocrit has been stable while in house and
no further evidence of GI bleeding.  Etiology could have been
small [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear vs gastritis.  Pt has no evidence of
cirrhosis by physical exam or labs.  He was maintained on IV PPI
twice a day and denied any further GI sx's.  He will be
discharged on once a day oral protonix.  Scope was initially
deferred because of increased risk [**2-16**] his DT's.  He was
scheduled for scope on the day of discharge but refused.
.
## EtOH withdrawal: pt states has had DT's in past.  Initially
placed in ICU for closer monitoring, where he required large
doses of benzodiazapines for withdrawl (hundreds of milligrams
of valium).  He was also started on scheduled haldol, which he
should continue as an outpt.  Psych was consulted who agreed
with this plan.  Thiamine and folate were continued.  He left
the ICU [**4-14**] and tried to leave the hospital twice, each time
requiring Code Purple to be initiated (psych emergency) where he
needed to transiently be restrained to avoid self injury.  By
the time of discharge, the pt was no longer withdrawing and not
delerious.
.
## ARF: BUN/Cr ratio indicate likely prerenal. Elevated bicarb
likely [**2-16**] vomiting. Anion gap likely [**2-16**] ARF as well as
starvation ketosis.  Renal failure and those associated
abnormalities improved with IVF's and nutritional support.  His
K and Mg were aggressively repleted.

## Elevated pancreatic enzymes: Lipase/Amylase >2:1 likely
affected by EtOH, however not elevated to a degree sufficient
enough to call true pancreatitis. Likely elevated [**2-16**] vomiting.
Resolved with no sequelae.
.
##HTN: unclear of pt's outpt regimen: started prn hydral for SBP
>160.  His htn was attributed to the unopposed sympathetic tone
of alcohol withdrawl.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o male w/ h/o EtOH abuse, UGI bleed, htn, pancreatitis,
EtOH withdrawal sz presenting w/ EtOH intoxication and abd pain
now with suspected withdrawal seizure requring high benzo doses.


1. EtOH withdrawl:

History of Etoh abuse and withdrawal seizure.  He was
intoxicated in the ED and
had a witnessed seizure in that context.  He received in total
about 100mg of valium while in the ED.  He was transferred to
the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] ICU for further monitoring.  He was monitored by CIWA
scale, and required minimal further benzodiazepines.  He
consistently had scores by CIWA scale of 0-2 and had no further
signs/symptoms of withdrawal. He had no further seizures during
his hospital course.

2. Acid-base: Primary hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic
alkalosis likely [**2-16**] vomiting, contraction. AG 22 c/w metabolic
acidosis likely uremic. Lactate wnl 2.2.
These acid/base disturbances, as well as hypokalemia and
hypomagnesemia were all corrected with volume resuscitation and
electrolyte repletion.

3. RLL opacity:

Persistent lung nodule in RLL seen on chest xray.  Initially
started on abx in
ED, but these were d/c in ICU, as there was no clear evidence of
infection.  A chest CT was performed, which demonstrated a 3cm
spiculated RLL nodule, concerning for malignancy, especially
given his smoking history. He will need further f/u and
diagnostic biopsy.  The team discussed the lesion with Mr.
[**Known lastname **], clearly stating that there was a high chance it was
malignant and the best chance of cure would be excision.  Mr.
[**Known lastname **] indicated he understood and would follow up at a clinic
appointment the team set up for him prior to his discharge.

4. ARF:

Consistent with pre-renal azotemia. Resolved with aggressive
volume resuscitation.
No further issues.

5. Follow up:

Complicated social situation with tenuous housing; lives on
street as well as with children.  Seen by SW while in house;
offered etoh counseling/programs, but patient refused.  He will
f/u with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 333**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 334**] in [**Hospital 191**] clinic; on discharge, this
appointment was set up.  He will need to apply for MassHealth
coverage as well.
He agreed to f/u, and understands that he needs further f/u for
this lung nodule.

Brief Hospital Course:
50 y/o M w/ h/o ETOH abuse, chronic pancreatitis, who presented
with signs and symptoms of ETOH withdrawal

1. ETOH w/d: Presented with tachycardia, hallucinations,
tremulousness. Given 40mg Valium in ED. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and
started on valium CIWA scale. Started on Folate, Thiamine, MVI.
Monitored on telemetry overnight. He had no evidence of seizure
or HD instabilitiy o/n. His CIWA was [**8-23**], mainly based on
agitation and tremulousness, and he recieved an additional 120mg
valium overnight. Early on HD 2 the patient demanded to leave.
It was explained to the patient that he has a high probability
of withdrawal seizure or DT's and that he needed continued ICU
monitoring. The patient reported that he understood this but
still wished to leave against medical advice. He was felt to
have capacity to make this decision since he had no evidence of
delirium and clearly understood his situation and risks
involved. The case was discussed with the on call psychiatry
resident, ICU medicine resident and ICU staff attending.
Therefore the patient signed out AMA on hospital day 2. Prior to
discharge we did have him ambulate around the intensive care
unit and he was able to do this without too much difficuluty,
although he was still a bit tremulous upon discharge. He had no
other evidence of active w/d symptoms.

2. Anion-gap Acidosis: Suspected secondary to ketoacidosis,
likely from poor PO intake. ETOH was negative suggesting against
ETOH related cause. Serum acetone was positive, with a normal
serum osm. His gap closed with IVF hydration.

3. Hypochloremic Metabolic Alkalosis: Secondary to HCL loss from
vomiting. Improved with IVF hydration.

4. Hematemesis: Limited hematemesis early the morning of
admission. He had no further episodes of blood loss and he was
guaiac negative on admission. Hematocrit remained stable
overnight.

5. Abd pain: Suspect secondary to chronic pancreatitis.
Amylase/Lipase unchanged from previous levels. AST/ALT 2:1 in
setting of h/o ETOH abuse. Recent CT ([**4-19**]) negative for liver
or GB dx, only fatty liver.

6. RLL lung mass: Seen on Chest CT from [**4-19**], concerning for
primary lung CA. Has not been worked up further. Not able to set
up follow-up as patient left AMA.

irradiation.  He had progressively deteriorated with
inability to walk being the most troublesome.  He is no
longer able to get his left leg to move when standing and he
feels the left arm is also weaker and his speech is much
worse.  His verbal responses are much slower and he has
significant word finding difficulty.  The pain in the left
leg at times is intense and the Morphine has helped with
this.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 349**] is an 89 year old man who presented with several
months of dizziness, thirst, and increased urination and was
found to be hyponatremic with a sodium of 114 on admission.
.
# Hyponatremia:
The patient was treated for hyponatremia with 3% saline solution
in the Medical Intensive Care Unit. Per the renal consult team
recommendations, the patient was placed on free water
restriction to 1L per day and 3% saline was infused at 40cc/hr
via PICC, with a goal of increasing the serum sodium by [**1-13**]
mEq/hour or <12 mEq/24 hrs. Over this initial 24 hours of
admission the patient's serum sodium increased from 114 to 119.
On day 3 of admission 3% saline solution was discontinued and
the patient was transfered to the floor. The nephrology team
that was consulted initially continued to follow the patient
during this admission and determined that the hyponatremia was
hctz-induced. The patient's serum sodium normalized with the
withdrawal of hctz and an SIADH work-up was not pursued, per
renal recommendations.
.
# Word-finding difficulty:
On initial presentation the patient experienced some
word-finding difficulty that resolved as his serum sodium
normalized. CT of the head was negative on admission. On
discharge the patient was able to converse fluently without any
word-finding abnormalities. The patient will follow up with his
outpatient neurologist.
.
# Anemia:
During this hospitalization the patient's hematocrit remained
stable at 35. Iron studies did not reveal iron-deficiency anemia
and the patient was guaiac negative on fecal occult blood test.
The patient will have outpatient follow up of his anemia.
.
# Home Safety:
The patient met with social worker who offered additional
support services which patient declined. VNA will be sent to
patient's house for home safety evaluation.
.
# Code status:
During this admission the patient stated that he wished to be
full code. The patient did not identify a health care proxy.

Service:  TRA


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Seventy-eight-year-old female
involved in a motor vehicle accident. She was an unrestrained
driver with no loss of consciousness, but was hit by a dump
truck with significant intrusion into the car. She has
complaint of chest pain and systolic blood pressure of 88 and
heart rate of 100 in the field.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Amyloidosis, depression, kidney
stones.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Breast implants 30 years ago, tubal
ligation, left hip replacement, question of kidney stone
surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Prozac.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Two cigarettes per day, 1-2 drinks per day.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature was 99.4, heart rate 92,
blood pressure 115/40, respiratory rate 20, and 94% on face
mask. She has a GCS of 15. Pupils were equal and reactive.
Trachea was midline. Heart was regular rate and rhythm.
Abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended. There was gross
hematuria visible. The pelvis was stable, but slightly
tender. Rectal was guaiac negative. Back had some abrasions,
but no step-offs. There were some abrasions of the
extremities, but no gross deformity.

LABS:  White blood cell count is 12.6, hematocrit 24.9,
platelets 241. Chem-7 with a sodium of 142, potassium 4.0,
chloride 110, bicarbonate 19, BUN 39, creatinine 1.3, glucose
114. Amylase is 133. Toxicology screen was negative.

Head CT was negative.

C. spine CT shows C2 fracture through the transverse foramen
bilaterally.

Chest CT showed bilateral small pneumothoraces with bilateral
rib fractures, bilateral pulmonary contusions.

Abdomen and pelvis CT showed a splenic laceration with no
free fluid, blood in the left renal pelvis with blood in the
ureter. There is a small liver laceration and a sacral
fracture as well as left iliac [**Doctor First Name 362**] small fracture.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the trauma
intensive care unit for close observation. Patient was seen
by the [**Doctor First Name **] service and was recommended to have a
nephrostomy tube placed which was done. There was difficulty
with the initial nephrostomy tube, and interventional
radiology inserted the nephrostomy tube.

Patient was seen by the thoracic surgery service for the
bilateral pneumothoraces. Chest tubes were attempted, but
unable to be passed due to scarring and the lungs cleared.
Patient was seen by the orthopedic spine service as well. It
was determined that the C2 fracture would require a hard
collar for at least 8-12 weeks.

Patient was in the trauma intensive care unit with
hematocrits being followed serially. On the evening of
[**8-2**], patient's serial hematocrits were significantly
altered. Patient dropped her blood pressure, became
hemodynamically stable, and the hematocrit was in the mid
teen's. It was decided at this time patient will be brought
to the emergency room emergently to have an open splenectomy.

Postoperatively, the patient was again brought to the trauma
intensive care unit. We gradually weaned the patient from the
ventilator over the course of the next 15-20 days. Patient
had some sputum samples which revealed some gram-negative
rods for which she was started on levofloxacin. A 14-day
course of that was to be initiated. Patient was started on
nutrition with ProMod with fiber by Dobbhoff feeding tube. A
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**8-9**]
successfully.

On the last few days in the intensive care unit, patient was
able to wean to a tracheostomy collar. This was tolerated
well. Speech and swallow was done the day of discharge, which
a Passy-Muir valve was not tolerated for extended periods of
time. However, it was felt in due time, patient would be able
to swallow on her own in a relatively short period of time.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Extended care facility.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Status post splenectomy.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:  Listed on , but they consistent of

Brief Hospital Course:
ID: Patient has been consistently febrile, initially started on
vancomycin and zosyn for presumed pneumonia, sputum cultures and

blood cultures positive for yeast. She was treated with
meropenam, vancomycin, flagyl, and then on [**8-31**] caspofungin
added. She continues to be febrile. Since [**8-30**] blood cultures
have been negative, sputum continues to grow yeast.

GI: On [**8-29**] she was noted to have rise in her LFT's and
abdominal
tenderness, she was taken to the OR for an exploratory
laparotomy
and found to have an ischemic colonic perforation. R colectomy
and ileostomy placement was performed at that time. She is still

not receiving feeds through the G tube.

Heme: Initially anemic, now hct has been stable in mid-20's.

Neuro: Pt when admitted on [**8-23**] was noted to follow commands and

express pain. She was on her home regimen of paxil for anxiety.
On day of admission she was started on propofol for agitation,
it
caused hypotension and it was weaned. She was at that time noted

to be sedated but still following commands. On [**8-24**] she was
switched to a versed drip. On [**8-26**] she was unarousable, versed
stopped and only given morphine PRN. She was noted on [**8-27**] to
follow commands and ""awake and alert."" [**8-29**] went to the OR, and
afterwards was treated with propofol and fentanyl. On [**8-30**] she
was noted to have minial movement of her LUE and none of her
RUE,
but moved both lower extremities in response to pain. On [**9-1**]
she
was reported to be ""following commands"" and responding to
painful
stimuli. She has been on a fentanyl drip until [**9-5**], when she
was
switched to a fentanyl patch. On [**9-7**] fentanyl patch was d/c'ed
and she has only been receiving fentanyl prn dressing changes.
Today, it was noted that despite being off sedation for several
days, she has not been awake or following commands initially
However this status has continues to improve and patient had
remained afebrile on trach trial up to 5 hours, she will need
continued wound care to incision with wet to dry dressing

Plt-Est: Low
PT: 15.0 PTT: 24.6 INR: 1.3
NDICATION: Low-grade fever and cough.

The lung volumes are low. Allowing for this factor, the heart
size is normal, but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.
The pulmonary vascularity is normal. There is some crowding of
vessels in the lower lung zones likely related to the low lung
volumes. A slightly more patchy area of opacity is seen in the
infrahilar region on the lateral view likely due to crowding of
vascular structures. No pleural effusions are identified.

Within the imaged portion of the upper abdomen, there is a
paucity of bowel gas suggesting underlying ascites.

IMPRESSION:
1. Low lung volumes. No definite pneumonia, but repeat study may
be helpful to fully exclude basilar pneumonia on this low lung
volume radiograph.
2. Probable ascites.
.
INDICATIONS: 76-year-old man with renal failure and cirrhosis.

COMPARISONS: Ultrasound from [**2137-2-28**].

TECHNIQUE: Renal ultrasound examination.

FINDINGS: The right kidney measures 10.5 cm in length, the left
10.9 cm. Both kidneys appear normal without stones, masses, or
hydronephrosis. There is a large amount of ascites, as seen on
the recent ultrasound as well. The liver is coarse and nodular
consistent with cirrhosis.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of hydronephrosis. Large amount of
ascites.
.
Reason: Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2137-3-11**]

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
76 year old man with NASH cirrhosis s/p GI bleed now requires
dialysis
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
Please place temporary IJ dialysis catheter on [**2137-3-11**]
CLINICAL INFORMATION: 76-year-old man with cirrhosis of the
liver, status post GI bleed, renal failure, needs temporal
dialysis catheter placement for hemodialysis.

PROCEDURE/FINDINGS: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 379**] [**Name (STitle) **]
and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**]. Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 380**], the attending radiologist, was
present and supervising throughout the procedure.

After the risks and benefits were explained to the patient,
written informed consent was obtained. The patient was placed
supine on the angiographic table. The right neck was prepped and
draped in the standard sterile fashion. Ultrasound confirmed the
right internal jugular vein was patent and compressible. A
preprocedure timeout was obtained to confirm the patient's name,
procedure, and the site. 5 cc of 1% lidocaine was applied for
local anesthesia. Under ultrasonographic guidance, a 21-gauge
needle was used to access the right internal jugular vein. A
0.018 guide wire was placed through the needle under
fluoroscopic guidance with the tip in the superior vena cava.
The needle was exchanged for a 4-French micropuncture sheath.
The wire was exchanged for a 0.035 guide wire under fluoroscopic
guidance with the tip in the inferior vena cava. The
micropuncture sheath was removed. The venous access was dilated
by using 12- and 14-French dilators. A 20-cm hemodialysis
catheter was placed over the wire with the tip in the right
atrium. The wire was removed. Two lumens were flushed, and the
catheter was secured with skin with sutures.

The patient tolerated the procedure well, and there were no
immediate complications.

During the procedure, two ultrasound films were taken.

IMPRESSION: Successful placement of a 20-cm, temporal
hemodialysis catheter through right internal jugular vein with
the tip in the right atrium. The catheter is ready to use.

Brief Hospital Course:
76 yo male w/PMHx sx for DM2, HTN, CKD, cirrhosis [**1-31**] NASH vs.
PSC who presented with acute on chronic renal failure, thought
[**1-31**] hepatorenal syndrome, complicated by an UGIB from esophageal
varices. Patient was transferred to the MICU on [**2137-3-8**], with
banding of esophageal varices and transfusion of 4u pRBC, now
stable and s/p placement of hemodialysis catheter and has
dialysis intiiated, also received large volume paracentesis with
removal of 1.1 L. His clinical status deteriorated due to
worsening cirrhosis and renal failure, and he was made CMO prior
to transfer to hospice.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal failure. Patient likely had ARF from
hepatorenal syndrome, triggered by intravascular volume
depletion from large volume paracentesis done several days prior
to admission, with contribution from UGIB during his admission.
Renal ultrasound has been negative for obstruction, urine
electrolytes [**Location (un) 381**] sodium c/w HRS, and urine sediment bland.
Urine eosinophils negative, less concerning for ATN as cause.
Patient received 500cc NS challenge on day of admission, with no
improvement in his renal function.  Patient was initiated on
hemodialysis and received three sessions with minimal
improvement in renal function. He was placed on nephrocaps, and
given octreotide and midodrine for treatment of HRS. He was
given albumin 12.5 mg twice daily. His diuretics were held.
.
#. GI bleeding. Patient had an episode of coffee grounds emesis
in the ED, with hx Grade II esophageal varices. He again had an
episode of upper GI bleeding while on the floor, and was
transferred to the MICU.
In the MICU, the patient received 2 units of blood and underwent
gastric banding for variceal bleeds.  He was continued on
octreotide gtt for 5 days and started on carafate. After the
banding, pt did not develop any further hematemasis, however, pt
received two more units for hct drop.  He was started on full
liquid diet. He was then transferred to the floor, where he was
stable for the next several days. He had an active T&S, and was
on protonix and carafate, scheduled for repeat endoscopy two
weeks later. On day prior to discharge, patient again started
vomiting up guaiac positive material. KUB showed an ileus, with
likely vomiting of feculent material mixed with blood. There was
no indication of active bleeding.

#. Scrotal edema. Patient c/o pain and tenderness at Foley
insertion site, and his foley was discontinued. He was not
having any urine output and received intermittent straight
catheterizations with minimal urine output. These were
discontinued as well due to patient discomfort. Bladder scan was
not reliable for urine in bladder due to increased ascites.
Patient's pain was controlled with morphine, viscous lidocaine,
and scrotal elevation with warm packs.
.
#. Cirrhosis [**1-31**] NASH vs. PSC. MELD score calculated at 32.
Patient received diagnostic paracentesis for SBP which was
negative, with final cx showing no growth, and was placed on SBP
prophylaxis with levofloxacin. He also received a large volume
paracentesis wtih removal of 1.1L . His nadolol was held. He had
a fluid restriction of 1500cc/day and his I/Os were monitored
closely. He was given lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy. His
spironolactone and furosemide were held due to concerns over
hypotension. He was continued on ursodiol. Liver consult
followed the patient throughout his hospital stay. He was given
Vit K SC for his coagulopathy.

#. Hyperkalemia. Likely [**1-31**] ARF. His hyperkalemia resolved with
kayexelate and dialysis.
.
#. Diabetes type 2. Patient was continued on home insulin
regimen until decision was made to make patient CMO.
.
#. PPx. Incentive spirometer. Senna/colace. PPI.
.
#. Code status: Patient was made CMO. A palliative care consult
was obtained. He was given a fentanyl patch with morphine elixir
for pain, and given ativan and dolasetron as well. He was
discharged to hospice.

Chief Complaint:
Transfer for respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
PA catheter placement

History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Name14 (STitle) 399**] is a 69 year-old female with a history of
diabetes, coronary artery disease, COPD who presents on transfer
for respiratory distress.
.
Per review of OSH records:  Patient presented to OSH with
complaints of [**2-7**] days of cough and dyspnea.  On the day prior
to transfer, she ws out in public and experienced a sudden onset
of worsened dyspnea.  She asked bystanders to call EMS and by
the time they arrived she was found unresponsive; did have a
pulse but was cyanotic and was intubed in the field.
.
At the OSH, initial CXR showed congestive heart failure.  She
was given IV lasix and placed on a nitro drip.  After several
hundred ml of urine was produced she became hypotensive,
requiring volume resuscitation and phenylephrine.  For a
possible pneumonia she received ceftriaxone and azithromycin.
She was transfused one unit of pRBC for a hct of 29.  An echo
done at the OSH showed apical hypokinesis with a fairly
preserved LVEF.
.
In speaking with the son, he reports that over the past six
months the patient's asthma has been under excellent control.
She was not requiring her albuterol rescue on most days.  It was
felt that this correlated, at least in part, to leaving a home
environment which had previously been infested with mold.  Over
the last week or so, boxes from her prior home had been brought
to her new home; it was the patient's feeling that these boxes
had contained mold and were the precipitant for her current
exacerbation.

Brief Hospital Course:
ASSESSMENT/PLAN [**10-24**]:
69 female with a history of asthma, coronary artery disease,
diabetes who present with respiratory distress, NSTEMI, acute
renal failure, currently vented.
.
1. Respiratory failure:
Pulmonary Dysfunction/Reactive Airway Disease: The most likely
etiology of the precipitating event in this patient is a severe
exaccerbation of her known reactive airway disease. Regarding
precipitant, the re-introduction of mold is certainly intriguing
and could also explain the CXR findings if it is felt that they
represent an inflammatory response to some inhalation.  Other
more typical precipitants include a viral infection, pneumonia,
PE (see below) and others.  The patient is was intubated and
vented, requiring high levels of sedation to tolerate the
ventilator. Initially with respiratory acidosis with poor O2 due
to vent disynchrony, but this improved with increased sedation.
Patient pulmonary exam has improved remarkably, but the
continued underlying pulmonary dysfunction could have been due
to demonstrated poor chest wall compliance (seen on inspiratory
hold), and current cardiac disease. Despite aggressive
bronchodilator therapy, steroids, and antibiotic therapy, she
continued to be difficult to adequately vent without substantial
sedation and paralysis. Patient per report was tolerating the
ventilator at the outside hospital.  It was unclear what was
causing her dysynchrony when the sedation was lightened. After
episode [**10-22**] patient required paralysis.  [**10-23**] patient
esophageal balloon revealed poor chest wall compliance and a
need for PEEP of 18 to normalize transplural pressures. Patient
tolerated PEEP to 18 with stable blood pressures until stopped
paralytics and lightened sedation.  Patient with prolonged
expiratory phase and stomach/CHF grunt during this time period
and CE positive (paO2 changed from 119-99), patient placed back
on paralytics. While paralyzed [**Last Name **] problem with lung resistence.
Attempts were made to wean sedation by using methadone and to
wean her PEEP, but she continued to need paralysis.  A decision
was made to attempt a PA catheter for better understanding of
her hemodynamic situation before attempting to extubate her.
During this procedure, she suffered asystole with no antecedent
arrhythmia noted.  She was able to be resuscitated, but required
ventricular pacing.  Her family then decided to withdraw care
and ventilator support.  She subsequently expired from cardiac
failure.
.
2. NSTEMI / CAD: Patient has had three coronary events.
At OSH in setting of hypotension, troponin to 0.6, felt to be
demand ischemia. Here enzymes trended downward, and heparin was
stopped [**10-20**].  Per the son, the patient has not had any chest
pain.
Here [**10-21**] O/N patient became hypotensive, tachycardia.
Tachycardia persisted for several hours, but did slowly trend
down in response to fluids. Ruled in for NSTEMI (CK 2895, MB 64,
Troponin 1.26). On [**10-23**] O/N patient weaned off sedation, became
agitated with prolonged expiration and grunt, CE from the time
on the event show active ischemia with increased enzymes, ECG
sinus LBBB with diffuse t-wave inversions demonstrating
concordance in inferior and lateral leads - worsened compared to
[**10-22**]. Transfused one unit pRBCs for ischemia with HCT <30. She
was continued on a heparin drip, aspirin, plavix, and
metoprolol. Cardiology was following during her stay.
.
3: Congestive Heart Failure: Patient has had multiple espisodes
of desaturations some of which are caused by attempts to wean
sedation; however, some may be caused by pulmonary edema. [**10-21**],
patient oxygenation and CXR responded very well to diuresis.
Patient had cardiac event after night of fighting the vent and
hypotension(toponin [**10-23**] 1.26). Demonstrated during this that
patient showed flash pulmonary edema c/w intermittent ischemia
causing CHF.  She was continued on isosorbide dinitrate 10mg TID
and diuresed as tolerated.
.
4. Leukocytosis: White blood cell count increasing, patient
afebrile (but on steroids), no clear source.
In the setting of respiratory failure, leukocytosis suspicious
for PNA. Must also consider stress response with recent
NSTEMI/Demand, episode where patient was found down vs
alternative sources for infection. [**Month (only) 116**] also be due to increased
steroids for patient pulmonary presentation. Legionella OSH
negative. She was treated empirically for pneumonia.
.
5. Hyperglycemia / Diabetes:
Was quite hyperglycemic at the OSH.  She was covered with at
[**Hospital1 18**] insulin gtt. Patient amylase and lipase were within normal
limits. Attributed high insulin requirements to steroids for
patient pulmonary disease.
.
6. Acute renal failure: At baseline.
Most likely flow related given recent hypotension. Admitted with
renal failure, with urine lytes with FeUREA 15.6% suggesting
pre-renal etiology. Initial improvement with fluids. Feel
patient at baseline (1-1.5).
.
7. Metabolic Acidosis: Resolved
Patient low bicarb and was volume resusitated with significant
amount of lactate and had a coronary event. When accounting for
bicarb it can be explained by patient's lactic acidosis. Gave
back bicarbonate as one liter D5 with 3 amps of bicarb [**10-22**] am.
Patient initially had a hyperchloremia which resolved with 2amps
bicarbonate [**9-21**].
.
8. Hypotension: Given cardiac events feel hypotension may not be
diuresis, but instead cardiac ischemia causing acute CHF with
hypotension. Hypertension upon arrival to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]. Hypotension with
intubation. Hypotension [**10-21**] O/N. Hypotensive [**10-23**] O/N in
setting of 2 L urine output on lasix and cardiac event. Improved
with decreased in PEEP from 18-14.
.
9. Tachycardia:
Reoccurred in the setting of hypotension and NSTEMI.
On admission felt tachycardia likely represents response to
pain, agitation given that she presents off sedation.  [**Month (only) 116**] be
component of volume depletion as well. With improved sedation
and IVF boluses the patient was no longer tachycardic [**9-21**]. Only
concern in the setting of tachycardia and respiratory distress
in relatively sedentary patient is PE. Although at this point
low suspicion given physical exam, and negative LENIs.  She was
given metoprolol for rate control.

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT/REASON FOR ADMISSION:  Ms. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 403**] is
a postoperative admission who was admitted directly to the
operating room for mitral valve repair versus replacement.
She was seen in preadmission testing prior to surgery.  At
that time, her chief complaint was occasional dyspnea on
exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 47-year-old woman with
known mitral regurgitation followed by electrocardiogram.
Cardiac catheterization done showed 3 to 4+ mitral
regurgitation with normal coronaries and an ejection fraction
of 67%.  Cardiac echocardiogram done in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year
showed an ejection fraction of 60% with mildly enlarged left
atrium.  No aortic insufficiency.  There was 3+ mitral
regurgitation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Mitral valve prolapse.
2.  Hypothyroidism.
3.  Varicosities of the lower extremities (left greater than
right).

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:   No past surgical history.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Levoxyl 50 mcg by mouth once per
day.

ALLERGIES:   The patient states no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her husband and two children.
Occupation as a writer.  She denies tobacco use.  Occasional
alcohol use.  Denies any other drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Her mother is alive.  Her father is alive,
status post mitral valve repair.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Her height was 5 feet
3.5 inches, her weight was 130 pounds.  In general, she was
well-appearing and in no acute distress.  The skin was
unremarkable.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed the pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light.
The extraocular movements were intact.  The sclerae were
anicteric.  The neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy.
There was no jugular venous distention.  There were no
bruits.  The chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Heart was regular in rate and rhythm.  First heart sounds and
second heart sounds.  There was a 3/6 systolic ejection
murmur that radiated throughout the precordium.  The abdomen
was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There were positive
bowel sounds.  There was no hepatosplenomegaly or
costovertebral angle tenderness.  The extremities were warm
and well perfused.  There was no clubbing, cyanosis, or
edema.  Varicosities bilaterally (left greater than right).
Neurologically, cranial nerves II through XII were grossly
intact.  A nonfocal examination.  The pulses revealed 2+
femoral bilaterally, 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses bilaterally,
and 2+ posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally, and 2+ radial
pulses bilaterally.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood
cell count was 5.7, her hematocrit was 33.2, and her
platelets were 199.  Her INR was 1.1.  Sodium was 136,
potassium was 3.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 25,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and blood
glucose was 92.  Liver function tests were within normal
limits.  Urinalysis was negative.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  Electrocardiogram showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 57 beats per minute.

A chest x-ray showed no active cardiopulmonary processes.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As stated previously, the
patient was a direct admission to the operating room on [**4-1**] where she underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair
via a right mid axillary mini-anterior thoracotomy with a
28-mm [**Doctor Last Name 405**] angioplasty.  Please see the Operative Report
for full details.

In summary, the patient had a minimally invasive mitral valve
repair.  Her bypass time was 130 minutes with a cross-clamp
time of 110 minutes.  She tolerated the operation well and
was transferred from the operating room to the Cardiothoracic
Intensive Care Unit.  At the time of transfer, the patient's
mean arterial pressure was 74 with a central venous pressure
of 6.  She was in a sinus rhythm at 89 beats per minute.  She
had a Levophed infusion at 0.3 mcg/kg per minute and propofol
at 20 mcg/kg per minute.

The patient did well in the immediate postoperative period.
Her anesthesia was reversed.  She was weaned from the
ventilator and successfully extubated.  She had no other
events on operative day.

On postoperative day one, the patient continued to require a
Levophed infusion for blood pressure support which was
titrated as tolerated.  Her Swan-Ganz catheter was removed on
postoperative day two.  The patient had weaned to off the
Levophed infusion, and she was transferred to the floor for
continued postoperative care and cardiac rehabilitation.

Additionally, on postoperative day two, the [**Initials (NamePattern4) 228**] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 406**]
drain was removed.  Over the next several days, the patient
had an uneventful hospitalization.

Once on the floor, with the assistance of the nursing staff
and the Physical Therapy staff, the patient's activity level
was advanced.  She remained hemodynamically stable throughout
her hospitalization.

On postoperative day four, it was decided that the patient
was stable and ready to be discharged to home.  At that time,
the patient's physical examination was as follows.  Vital
signs revealed her temperature was 99, her heart rate was 92
(sinus rhythm), her blood pressure was 104/68, her
respiratory rate was 20, and her oxygen saturation was 97% on
room air.  Her weight preoperatively was 59 kilograms, at
discharge was 66.7 kilograms.

Laboratory data revealed a white blood cell count of 7.7, her
hematocrit was 23.1, and her platelets were 129.  Sodium was
137, potassium was 3.7, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 31,
blood urea nitrogen was 8, creatinine was 0.5, and her blood
glucose was 99.

Physical examination revealed she was alert and oriented
times three.  She moved all extremities.  She followed
commands.  Respiratory examination revealed the lungs were
clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Cardiovascular
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  First heart
sounds and second heart sounds.  The abdomen was soft,
nontender, and nondistended with normal active bowel sounds.
The extremities were warm and well perfused with no clubbing,
cyanosis, or edema.  Right thoracotomy incision with
Steri-Strips, opened to air, clean and dry.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg every day.
2.  Niferex 150 mg mouth once per day.
3.  Vitamin C 500 mg twice per day.
4.  Toprol-XL 12.5 mg once per day.
5.  Levoxyl 50 mcg by mouth once per day.
6.  Colace 100 mg twice per day.
7.  Lasix 20 mg once per day (times two weeks).
8.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq once per day (times two weeks).
9.  Dilaudid 2 mg to 4 mg q.4-6h. as needed.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Status post minimally invasive mitral valve repair via a
right thoracotomy.
2.  Hypothyroidism.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Good.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient was to be discharged home
with [**Hospital6 407**].

Chief Complaint:
shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation and mechanical ventilation
Transesophageal echocardiogram
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy


History of Present Illness:
Ms. [**Known lastname 426**] is an 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent PCI, severe
AS s/p valvuloplasty [**4-/2174**], and recently treated for possible
pneumonia with ceftazidime [**Date range (1) 427**] admitted with shortness of
breath and hypotension.

Ms. [**Known lastname 428**] husband reports that he has observed her breathing
very fast around 3 or 4 in the morning for the last couple of
nights.  On the day of admissin, she woke up short of breath and
breathing quickly.  He used a stethoscope (which he has to help
with home maintenance) and heard a hissing/wheezing on her right
chest, which prompted him to call 911.  She continued breathing
fast until she was intubated in the ED with her consent.  He
notes that she has had a minimally productive cough since her
last admission, though she has not had fevers or chills.  She
had diarrhea for about a day recently, but this has resolved.
Her nephrologist contact[**Name (NI) **] her on [**6-16**] and advised her to
decrease her lasix from 160mg daily to 80mg because of her
rising creatinine.  Despite this change, her daily weight has
remained stable at 119-120 pounds.  She has been compliant with
1L fluid restriction.

In the ED, her initial VS were:  99.8   115   122/75   30s   82%
NRB.  She was noted to have crackles on her pulmonary exam.  She
was given rocuronium, etomidate, and versed and intubated
urgently.  Shortly after propofol gtt was started, she dropped
her pressures into the into the 70s (per report; recorded in the
80s).  Bedside Echo was done to evaluate for concern of
tamponade.  Echo demonstrated large anterior fat pad and stable
small loculated pericardial effusion.  Left cordis was placed
for hypotension; there was concern that the line might be in the
carotid, and CT was done to confirm placement.  Radiology
reports that the line is in the left brachiocephalic vein.
Pressures increased to 110s after 500cc IV fluid bolus.  She
received vanc, zosyn, levofloxacin, and ceftriaxone in the ED.

On review of symptoms, she denies any prior history of stroke,
TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeding at the
time of surgery, myalgias, hemoptysis, black stools or red
stools. She denies recent fevers, chills or rigors. She denies
exertional buttock or calf pain.

Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
ankle edema, palpitations, syncope or presyncope.  +3 pillow
orthopnea, although she tends to move to flat position during
sleep.  She does not sore and her husband denies witnessed
apneas, though she has never had a formal evaluation.

ABG 7.36/46/74 after intubation

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 122 with LBBB with no
significant change compared with prior dated [**2174-6-6**].

TELEMETRY demonstrated:  Sinus tachy at 106

TTE [**2174-6-19**]:
The right atrial pressure is indeterminate. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is severely depressed (LVEF<20 %).
Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed.
Significant aortic stenosis is present (not quantified). The
mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild to moderate
([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing,
the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly
UNDERestimated.] There is a small, primarily anterior
pericardial effusion most prominent around the right atrium and
right ventricle with a prominent anterior fat pad. No right
atrial or right ventricular diastolic collapse is seen (may be
absent in the setting of pulmonary artery hypertension).
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2174-5-30**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (but without
hemodynamic compromise) and left ventricular systolic function
is more depressed.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
A right internal jugular catheter terminates in the right
atrium.
An endotracheal tube terminates 2 cm above the carina. A
nasogastric tube
terminates past the stomach with its tip outside the plane of
imaging.
The cardiomediastinal silhouette is mildly enlarged. There is
increased
perihilar haziness with interstitial fluid that is mostly
central. There is also increased peribronchial cuffing. There is
no evidence of pleural
effusion. Moderate S-shaped scolisosis is noted.
IMPRESSION: Acute central pulmomary edema.

CXR [**2174-6-19**]:
Newly inserted nasogastric tube projects over the stomach. The
tip
of the endotracheal tube is 3 cm above the carina. The size of
the cardiac
silhouette and the bilateral parenchymal opacities show no major
change.

CT Chest without contrast [**2174-6-19**]:
1. The left IJ introducer sheath is terminating in the proximal
left
brachiocephalic vein without immediate post-procedure
complications.
2. Diffuse bilateral septal thickening and ground-glass
opacities with
associated small bilateral pleural effusions suggesting moderate
pulmonary
edema. Bibasilar atelectasis and coexistent pneumonia cannot be
excluded and should be clinically correlated.
3. Comparative evaluation of pulmonary nodules is limited due to
respiratory motion and diffuse background pulmonary edema.
Further evaluation for stability should be undertaken post
resolution of background pulmonary edema.
4. Extensive atherosclerotic aortic valvular and coronary
calcifications are unchanged.
5. Large axial hiatal hernia.
6. Stable small pericardial effusion.

TTE [**2174-6-23**]:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. No atrial septal defect is
seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. LV systolic function appears depressed. There are
complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There
are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are
severely thickened/deformed. There is at least moderate aortic
valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. [Due to
acoustic shadowing, the severity of aortic regurgitation may be
significantly UNDERestimated.] The mitral valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. Mild to moderate ([**12-15**]+) mitral regurgitation
is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
IMPRESSION: No vegetations seen. Significant aortic stenosis,
mild to moderate mitral regurgitation, depressed LV function.

CT Head w/o contrast [**2174-6-26**]:
1. Focal region of hypoattenuation within the right anterior
limb of the
internal capsule. Etiology of this finding is unknown as well as
duration and differential diagnosis includes an old lacunar
infarct versus new region of ischemia. Further evaluation may be
obtained with MRI including diffusion- weighted imaging sequence
to evaluate for acute ischemia.
2. Probable old lacunar infarction within the right corona
radiata.
3. Bifrontal lobe cerebral atrophy.
4. Moderate confluent periventricular white matter chronic
ischemic changes.

MR [**Name13 (STitle) 430**] w/o contrast [**2174-6-27**]:
There is no evidence for acute ischemia or acute hemorrhage.
There are scattered small vessel ischemic sequelae in the
subcortical and
periventricular white matter. There are old lacunes in the right
anterior
limb of the internal capsule. The ventricles and sulci are
prominent but
likely age appropriate.
There is focal prominence of bifrontal extra-axial spaces which
may suggest focal volume loss in the bifrontal lobes. There is
no hydrocephalus.
Intracranial flow voids are maintained.
MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] demonstrates patency of the anterior
and posterior circulations. There is stenosis within the limits
of this exam. There is a hypoplastic right A1 segment. The right
vertebral artery is relatively hypoplastic. There is a possible
3-mm aneurysm on the left at the junction of the cavernous and
supraclinoid ICA. Additionally, there is a possible 2-mm
aneurysm of the supraclinoid ICA posteriorly in close proximity
to the ICA bifurcation.


Brief Hospital Course:
80yo woman with severe AS, CHF, CRI, admitted with respiratory
failure likely [**1-15**] acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure.
She was diuresed with Lasix, improving her respiratory function
to the point where she no longer required supplemental oxygen,
but subsequently developed CRAO, leading to stroke workup and
anticoagulation with heparin, leading to GIB due to esophagitis
and gastritis, leading to transfusion for dropping hematocrit,
leading to acute exacerbation of chronic heart failure due to
volume overload.
.
# Respiratory failure [**1-15**] acute on chronic heart failure:
Presented in respiratory distress with SaO2 82% on NRB.
Respiratory failure most likely multifactorial, involving
chronic heart failure due to aortic stenosis, exacerbated
acutely by volume overload and pulmonary edema in the setting of
decreased Lasix dosage. Intubated in ED, extubated on hospital
day 2. Continued to require 4LNC, desaturating to 80s on room
air. Diuresed with multiple boluses of Lasix IV. Gradually
weaned to room air, with O2 saturation in mid to high 90s while
resting, but desaturating deeply to upper 80s with ambulation.
Unfortunately, she subsequently developed a GIB, leading to
transfusion of multiple units of PRBCs, resulting in shifts in
volume status and worsening oxygen saturations and increasing
need for supplemental oxygen. She was once again diuresed with
multiple doses of Lasix IV, at times requiring combination with
metolazone. She was gradually weaned off of oxygen until she no
longer required supplemental oxygen and was euvolemic on exam.
.
# GIB:
Vomited a large quantity of blood after starting heparin. Has a
history of gastritis on recent admission in [**2174-5-15**]. GI was
consulted and EGD done, showing gastritis and esophagitis but no
frank bleeding. She was started on an IV PPI and antiemetics.
She was initially transfused two units of blood in the setting
of the acute bleed, and subsequently received another unit for
gradually decreasing hematocrit. Of note, even before her
episode of acute GIB, her stools were noted to be guaiac
positve. GI felt that given that the GIB occurred in the setting
of being started on heparin and having a previous history of
gastritis, there was no need to arrange for GI follow up unless
she desired.
.
# Central Retinal Artery Occlusion:
Awoke one afternoon with sudden loss of vision in R eye.
Ophthalmology was consulted and diagnosed patient with likely
CRAO. Paracentesis was performed to lower intraocular pressure.
Neurology consulted for stroke workup. CT and MRI showed signs
of old ischemia and infarction but no acute events. Started on
heparin drip for concern about emboli, but heparin discontinued
for GIB. Carotid ultrasound showed thrombus in L IJ, possibly
related to recently removed Cordis, but otherwise no significant
stenosis. An appointment was made for her to follow up with a
retinal specialist. Of note, she reports that she is already
followed by a retinal specialist at the MEEI for her macular
degeneration.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:
Currently s/p recent valvuloplasty, with valve area 0.9cm.
Evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery - felt to be poor surgical
candidate, both for valve replacement and for apico-aortic
conduit, given significantly calcified aorta, small body habitus
and poor renal function. Cardiothoracic surgery recommended
considering enrollment in percutaneous valve trial.
.
# Renal Failure:
In consultation with renal team, it was felt that it was
necessary to diurese the patient in order to improve her
pulmonary status. Baseline Cr 1.3-2.5 over last month.
Creatinine increased to 2.7 initially, but subsequently improved
with continued diuresis. HD line removed on hospital day 2 for
gram positive cocci on blood cultures (she required hemodialysis
in [**Month (only) 116**], but has not required it since). The patient was diuresed
to a creatinine of 2.4 on the day of discharge so that she would
be slightly dry on discharge and therefore euvolemic on her home
diet.
.
# Infection:
Initial ED blood culture grew Viridans streptococcus, resistant
to penicillin. HD line tip culture grew staphylococcus aureus,
resistant to oxacillin, sensitive to vancomycin. Pt was treated
with vancomycin starting in the ED. Per infectious disease
consult, due to possibility of endocarditis (absence of
vegetations on TEE did not rule out endocarditis), given blood
culture with Viridans streptococci, the pt will require
treatment with 6 weeks of vancomycin for Viridans streptococcus.
She will require vancomycin, dosed for troughs of under 20,
until [**7-31**]. A PICC line was placed for administration of
antibiotics to treat possible endocarditis.
.
# Anemia:

Discharge Disposition:
Home With Service

Facility:
[**Hospital 119**] Homecare

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary Diagnosis:
Acute respiratory failure secondary to acute congestive heart
failure
Septicemia
Central retinal artery occlusion
Gastrointestinal bleeding due to esophagitis/gastritis
.
Secondary Diagnoses:
Aortic stenosis
Coronary artery disease
Pulmonary edema
Chronic renal insufficiency
Hypertension
Anemia with chronic GI bleed
Scoliosis


Discharge Condition:
Stable vital signs with appropriate follow-up.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with acute respiratory distress due to fluid
in your lungs. When you initially presented, you required
intubation and mechanical ventilation to provide you with
adequate oxygenation.

Your aortic stenosis (which is the narrowing of one of your
heart valves) makes it very difficult to manage your fluid
status. You were evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery to see if
they would suggest replacing your aortic valve, but they felt
that you would not be a good candidate for surgery because of
your other medical conditions, which would make surgery
extremely risky.

You were treated with Lasix to decrease the amount of fluid in
your lungs, improving your ability to breathe. Your ability to
breathe gradually improved to the point that you did not require
supplemental oxygen.

You developed a loss of vision in your right eye. You were seen
by an ophthalmologist who made a small hole in your eye to drain
some fluid and diagnosed you with likely central retinal artery
occlusion, a condition in which a vessel supplying blood to the
eye becomes clogged. You were started on anticoagulation with
heparin.

You developed a gastrointestinal bleed, vomiting a quantity of
blood and having a number of maroon colored stools. You were
seen by a gastrointestinologist who performed an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy, showing esophagitis and gastritis.
Heparin was discontinued and you were started on IV proton pump
inhibitors.

A sample of your blood showed that you had an infection in your
blood with a bacteria known as Viridans streptococci. You were
initially started on ceftriaxone, an antibiotic, to treat this
bacteria. Because the particular bacteria you were infected with
turned out to be resistant to penicillin, the ceftriaxone was
discontinued and you were treated with vancomycin. You will
require treatment with vancomycin for a total of six weeks,
until [**7-31**]. A PICC line, a special type of IV line, was
placed so that you can continue to receive the vancomycin at
home.

Your hemodialysis catheter was removed. Because you had not
required dialysis recently, it was felt that the catheter was
not necessary. The tip of the cathether was noted to have
another type of bacteria on it, Staphylococcus aureus. This
bacteria was resistant to many antibiotics and required
treatment with vancomycin. You were treated with vancomycin for
the Staphylococcus aureus. This infection required only
treatment for 5-7 days, so this bacteria has probably been
adequately treated already.

When you first were admitted to the hospital, your kidneys were
functioning poorly. Your creatinine, which increases when your
kidneys are not working well, reached a peak of 2.7. As we
treated you with Lasix and decreased the amount of fluid in your
body, your kidney function actually improved.

You were noted to be somewhat anemic. When you first came in,
your hematocrit was near 30. It gradually dropped to
approximately 20.  You were given two units of blood, and your
hematocrit increased to the upper 20s. Subsequently, your
hematocrit dropped again after you had your GI bleed. You were
again transfused two units of blood. A few days later, your
hematocrit was noted to trend down, so you were transfused
another unit.

1. Please take all medications as prescribed.
***Medication Changes:***
Your aspirin was changed to 81mg daily. Your carvedilol was
increased and your prilosec increased to twice daily. Your
Cozaar is being held because of your renal function. Vancomycin
was started to treat bacteria in your blood. Sevelamer was
started to regulate the phosphate level in your blood as your
kidneys are not working as well to remove it.

2. Please attend all follow-up appointments listed below.

3. Please call your doctor or return to the hospital if you
develop chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness,
decreased urine output, or any other concerning symptom.

4. Please weigh yourself every morning and call your doctor if
your weight goes up by 3 pounds in 1 day or 6 pounds in 3 days.

5. Please limit yourself to a 2 gm sodium diet; written
information was reviewed with you about your diet.

6. Please limit your fluid intake to a fluid restriction of
1000mL/day.

7. While you are on the vancomycin, you will need to have weekly
labs drawn and faxed to the infectious disease doctors [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was admitted with presumed CHF exacerbation most likely
secondary to increased dietary salt intake and severe aortic
stenosis. Pt was diursed and treated with O2.


CHR Exacerbation:
Patient was diuresed.  She was initially started on antibiotics
for question on pneumonia which were then stopped after her
white count normalized.

She was continued on her IV vancomycin course which was started
at a previous hospital stay for strep viridans bacteremia. She
was afebrile for the duration of her stay.  The patient was
diursed and treated with oxygen and improved.  Pt has prior hx
of GI bleed and had heme positive stools.  Her hct remained
stable throughout her hospitalization.  She received 2 units of
PRBC for a hct of 23, which was later determined to be near her
baseline of 25.

She was discharged in stable condition to home with home oxygen
as she had ambulatory desats to 87%.  She has follow with her
PCP for [**Name9 (PRE) 444**] of her vancomycin levels and follow with with
GI for colonoscopy.  She was also instructed to follow up with
her cardiologist for managment of congestive heart failure and
her neprologist for her kidney failure.

Her carvelilol was increased to 21.5mg twice a day and her
neurontin was changed to 300mg every other day.  She was resumed
on all her other home medications.

Coronary artery disease:
Pt with history of CAD and has had presious stent.  Her cardiac
enzymes were negative and there were no ECG changes.  Her ACE-i
was held in the setting of her acute renal failure, she was
continued on her Aspirin and beta blocker.

Aortic Stenosis:
Her severe aortic stenosis was thought to be a contributing
factor to her current CHF exacerbation.  She has had a past
valvuloplasty and was determinted not to be a candidate for any
further intervention at this time

Strep viridans bacteremia:
She had a rencent echocardiogram that was negative for
endocarditis.  Her blood cultures were negative for her length
of stay.  She remained on Vancomycin.

GI bleed: Pt had guiac positive, melanotic stools.  She remained
on her PPI and was set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 79**] as an outpatient for
colonoscopy.

Renal Failure: Baseline Cr appears to be close to 1.6 but her Cr
has been fluctuating up to 2.7 on prior admission. She continues
to have good urine output and her cr trended down.

[**2174-8-1**]: Upper GI Endoscopy - According to the GI Fellow, they
had found several bleeding AVM's at the Gastric and Duodenal
border similar to an endoscopy done a month prior.  GI was able
to cauterize 3 of the AVM's.


Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 80yo woman with h/o CAD s/p recent DES to LCX and AS
s/p valvuloplasty admitted on [**7-22**] for another CHF exacerbation,
receiving diuresis/HD, pt course was complicated by GI bleeding,
underwent dialysis prior to leaving.  It was decided that the
patient was not a candidate for surgical intervention of the
stenotic valve at this time.
.
# CHF Exacerbation: The patient had several episodes of
desaturation and acute shortness of breath.  The patient was
given progressive doses of lasix, typically IV at 100mg.  She
became refractory to Lasix dosing and required priming with
diuril.  The patient was transferred from CCU to the floor, at
which point she developed both acute shortness of breath and
progressive hematemesis which prompted her return back to the
CCU.  She developed renal failure shortly thereafter, and
required hemodialysis.  After frequent dialysis, the Pt. is now
satting at 98% on 4L and is fairly comfortable.
.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other
coronaries w/o obstructive dz. No evidence of acute ischemic
changes during admission.  The patient had been receiving ASA
and Plavix along with carvedilol, the ASA and plavix were
discontinued after the episode of upper GI bleeding.
.
# Aortic Stenosis: s/p valvuloplasty, not thought to be good
surgical candidate due to large atheroma.  No realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.  Last TTE [**7-27**] w/aortic valvular area of 0.5
cm2.
.
# ID Issues: Pt recently ended course of Vancomycin for strep
veridins bacteremia.  Blood and Urine cultures have been
negative, TTE negative for any endocarditis.  Urine cultures
negative with postitive UA.  The patient had her foley removed
and she completed a course of cipro for 5 days.
.
# Upper GI Bleed: The patient devleped retching and hematemesis
on [**8-1**], which was similar to an episode a month earlier.  At
that time she was scoped and found to have multiple bleeding
AVM's which were cauterized and had a stable Hct.  At this time,
the patient was found to again have multiple AVM's which were
bleeding.  The patient was transferred back to the ICU after a
hematocrit drop of over 7 to 19, was given 3 units of blood.
She summarily went into flash pulmonary edema with concomitant
renal failure, and had to be dialyzed.  The patient was given 1
more unit of blood and placed on Epo before discharge, Hct has
been stable at baseline of 26 for the 48 hours prior to
discharge.
.
# Acute on Chronic Renal Failure:  The patient had been
responsive to high doses of lasix (100mg) with diuril priming.
However, when the patient developed hematemesis and had an acute
blood loss, she subsequently developed renal failure, and when
she had a subsequent episode of flash pulmonary edema, she
received urgent dialysis and a tunnelled HD line was placed.
She received dialysis prior to discharge, and had been followed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 118**].

History of Present Illness:
Pt is a 80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**],
severe aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite
recent aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent
hospitalizations for CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), and
ESRD recently restarted on HD who returns w/SOB. She was
admitted on [**2174-7-22**] for CHF exacerbation and discharged
yesterday. She was initally treated with Lasix, went into
worsening renal failure, and started on hemodialysis. Her course
was also complicated by upper GI bleed, of which an EGD showed
multiple AVMs. She required total of 5 units of PRBCs and by
discharge, HCT was stable at 26. She received her last
transfusion yesterday at HD.
Pt was discharged to rehab. She ate well for dinner under 2 gm
of sodium diet. She report feeling warm the evening prior to
admission but was afebrile. She still felt warm and diaphoretic
this morning. Again, she was afebrile per her husband. She did
have increased productive cough with mostly clear, occasionally
blood-tinged phlegm. She then became acutely short of breath
while lying down. She denied any CP, palpitations, nausea,
vomiting. She asked to return to the hospital.
.
In the ED, her initial VS were: T98, BP 150/80, HR 130, RR 42,
O2 sat 92% on ?RA. BiPap was started and her BP fell to 72/38,
and Bipap was switched to NRB. She was started on neo gtt and BP
came up to 130s/60s. BiPap was restarted with O2 sat of 100%. A
CVL was placed int he R groin. She also received ceftazidime and
vanc. She was transferred on NRB off neo.
.
On review of symptoms, her husband denies any prior history of
stroke, TIA, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
bleeding at the time of surgery. She continues to complain of
leg pain for which she was taking neurotin and vicodin.
.
Cardiac review of systems is notable for absence of chest pain,
palpitations, syncope, or presyncope. She does have dyspnea on
exertion, orthopnea at baseline. She has never had ankle edema
in the past.

Brief Hospital Course:
80 yo woman with h/o CAD s/p cypher DES to LCX [**2174-5-13**], severe
aortic stenosis with valvular area of 0.5 cm2 despite recent
aortic valvuloplasty on [**2174-5-11**], frequent hospitalizations for
CHF exacerbation (last d/c [**2174-8-5**]), upper GI bleed from AVMs,
and ESRD recently restarted on HD who returned w/SOB, dialyzed,
and discharged back to extended care facility.
.
# CHF Exacerbation:  Patient initially presented with volume
overload on CXR and acute shortness of breath, was placed on
facemask, then later weaned to nasal cannula.  The patient was
emergently dialyzed, and subsequently her shortness of breath
resolved.  The patient was continued on low O2 nasal cannula,
followed via serial CXR's, and was given her outpatient dose of
carvedilol.
.
# Coronary artery disease: DES to LCx in [**2174-5-11**], other
coronaries w/o obstructive disease. Patient had CP the night
before admission and ECG showed J Point elevation.  Patient was
given O2 and cardiac enzymes were sent.  Patient was chest pain
free subsequently, EKG's were done which showed some minor
elevations, but none concerning enough in lieu of her existing
LBBB.  Patient was continued on her beta blocker, CE's were
followed and remained within the range of 0.11 which is her
chronic level and not concerning given the lack of an acute
rise, and her existing chronic kidney disease.  Plavix and ASA
were held given her recent upper GI bleed.
.
# Aortic Stenosis:  Worsened after valvuloplasty in [**4-21**]. Last
TTE [**7-27**] w/aortic valvular area of 0.5 cm2.  No realistic
percutaneous option as patient has 4 exclusion criteria for most
feasible trial.
.
# Anxiety:  Patient has had considerable anxiety on this
admission and during her stay at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab.  The patient was
amenable to and was given a prescription for citalopram.
.
# ID:  Pt presented with leukocytosis, though it later resolved
along with the rest of her CBC values, suggesting an inaccurate
measurement.  Pt had been afebrile and most recent WBC has
decreased to WNL.  U/A was positive but contaminated and pt had
long history of positive U/As with negative UCx, recently
completed 5 day course of cipro.  Pt recently ended course of
Vancomycin for strep veridins bacteremia. Blood and Urine
cultures were negative throughout admission, TTE negative for
any endocarditis.
.
# Upper GI Bleed: Hct suspiciously high.  No sig. bleeding.
Continued protonix [**Hospital1 **].
.
# Acute on chronic RF on Dialysis: Pt was given emergent
dialysis the day of admission, was also given EPO that she was
scheduled to receive.  Her shortness of breath resolved with
subsequent scheduled dialyses.
.
# Neovascular glaucoma:  Patient developed severe eye pain on
[**8-10**] while at dialysis.  On physical exam, patient's right eye
was injected, her pupil was dilated and non-reactive, and she
experienced pain in right eye when shining pen light into left
eye.  Ophthalmology was consulted, and she was found to have
neovascular glaucoma, an uncommon complication of retinal artery
occlusion.  Patient was started on Timolol, Alphagon,
Prednisolone, and latanoprost eye drops in right eye, twice
daily.  She was then seen in the [**Hospital 464**] clinic where she
underwent Pan-retinal phototherapy, vitrial tap and avastin
injection, OD.   Her eye drops were changed to a new medical
regiment including iopidine, azopt, alphagan, prednisolone,
atropine and erythromycin.  The patient was scheduled for a
follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on Tuesday, [**8-16**].

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you became acutely
short of breath.  It was later believed that this episode was
similar to other episodes of shortness of breath that you have
experienced.  Those experiences were due to your heart being
unable to beat strongly enough through your narrowed valve and
your body having an excess of fluid, which backed up into your
lungs.  As a result, you required dialysis, which removed much
of the fluid in your lungs.  In your previous admission, you
were set up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Additionally, Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 118**] will be able to make rounds at the [**Hospital 100**] Rehab facility
to which you are going.  If you continue to experience any acute
shortness of breath, extreme chest pain, or severe
light-headedness, please contact your primary care provider at
once.

In addition to the above, please weigh yourself every morning
abd adhere to a 2 gm sodium diet.

Brief Hospital Course:
She was admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2141-8-16**] for a ""Whipple Procedure"".

Pain: She had an epidural for pain control. She had an excellent
pain level and the epidural remained in place for 4 days. She
was then switched to a PCA and eventually switched to PO
Percocet with good pain control.

GI: She was NPO with a NGT and IV fluids. The NGT was removed
POD 3 and she was started on sips POD 4. Her diet was advanced
slowly as she had return of bowel function. She was noted to
have some loose bowel movements x 3 on POD 5. These resolved in
a day. On POD 6, a JP amylase was 44 and her drain was D/C'd POD
7. The staples were D/C'd on POD 8. There were no sign of
redness or infection.

Renal: She had low urine output post-operatively and she
received a 500 cc bolus of LR. A U/S of her kidneys was
unremarkable and showed no hydronephrosis. She did not respond
to the bolus and continued to be oliguric. She was transferred
to the SICU for further monitoring. POD 2, her urine output
began to improve and her creatinine remained low.

Heme/ID: She was noted to have a temperature of 101.1 on POD 2.
Blood cultures and urine cultures were negative. Her temperature
improved with hydration.

Neuro: The patient fell while getting out of bed. She felt
""dizzy"" upon waking. She is alert and oriented to person, place,
month, President, and not year. She had no signs of head trauma,
or fractures.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
L thoracotomy with pericardial window and chest tube placement

History of Present Illness:
72 W from [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 466**] [**Country 467**], with multiple cancers including ovarian
(s/p s/p TAH SBO and 6 cycles of ctaxol/carboplatinium) and
cholangiocarcinoma (s/p whipple) with mets of uncertain origin
to liver and lung, recently admitted [**4-6**]-22 for CAP
(treated with azithro), originally admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for SOB,
orthopnea, and coughing which was initially attributed to CHF,
symptomatic hyponatremia (increasing confusion, lethary), and
ARF.  Cards was consulted and an echocardiogram revealed a
pericardial fluid collection with tamponade.  She was sent
urgently to the OR for a pericardial window via L thoracotomy.
She was out of the OR by [**8-28**] PM, extubated by 0400 the day of
transfer, and seemed to be doing well.  She was sitting up in a
chair when she was noticed to be unresponsive, but still
breathing and with a pulse.  She was transferred back to her bed
and at that ppint was noticed to be in full cardiac and
respiratory arrest without pulse or spontaneous respirations.
Patient did have a rhythm on monitor so patient was diagnosed
with PEA arrest.  CPR was initiated, she received 2 amps of epi
and an an of calium, she was intubated, started on Neo, and had
a femoral line placed.  Within 15 minutes pulse returned.  A
stat repeat ECHO was performed at that time and patient was
found to have [**Male First Name (un) **] (systolic anterior motion), severe MR, and new
wall motion abnormalities but no re-accumulation of pericardial
effusion.  She is now being transferred to the MICU for further
work-up and management.

IMAGING:
CT SCAN [**9-7**]
CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST: Dependent atelectases are
present within
the lung bases bilaterally. There is no pleural effusion.
Visualized heart
and pericardium are unremarkable.

There is a striated appearance of bilateral kidneys, with
peripheral wedge- shaped hypodensities bilaterally. The largest
of these hypodensities is in the upper pole of the left kidney.
There is associated marked inflammatory stranding surrounding
both kidneys. Additionally, contrast is seen to excrete normally
from both kidneys. However, there is circumferential wall
thickening involving both ureters throughout its course. These
findings are overall suggestive of bilateral pyelonephritis,
with associated ureteritis. Although no discrete abscess is
identified, the hypodensity in the upper pole of the left
kidney, is likely at risk for developing an internal abscess.

The liver and gallbladder are within normal limits, with a focal
hypodensity adjacent to the gallbladder, may reflect an area of
focal fat. Spleen, pancreas, and adrenal glands are
unremarkable.

The stomach, small bowel, and large bowel are unremarkable. The
appendix is not definitively visualized, without secondary
findings to suggest acute appendicitis.

There is no free fluid or free air. Scattered retroperitoneal
nodes are seen, not meeting CT size criteria for pathologic
enlargement.

Urinary bladder, rectum are unremarkable. There is no pelvic
lymphadenopathy or free fluid.
IMPRESSION:
Findings most compatible with bilateral pyelonephritis and
ureteritis.
Although no discrete abscess is identified, a hypodensity within
the left
upper pole is seen, which may be at risk for developing into an
abscess. Close interval followup is suggested.

60 yo female with hx of chronic hepatitis C infection (without
cirrhosis) presenting to the ED with 4 day hx of dysuria, chills
and found to have a grossly positive U/A with evidence of
bilateral pyelonephritis on CT Abd/pelvis who became hypotensive
to 80/30.
.
# Pyelonephritis/Sepsis: Pt w/ signs and sx of UTI for several
days; most likely with ascending GU infection. The patient has
no recent UTIs or hx of resistent organisms. The patient
presented to the ICU in stable condition.  CT scan of was
performed and consistent with pyelonephritis w/ no discrete
abscess, but showed a hypodensity that could represent possible
developing abscess in the left upper pole. She receieved cipro
in the ED prior to coming to the ICU and prior to blood
cultures.  The patient's blood pressures continued to range SBP
70-90's, but the patient had good mentation, urine output,
peripheral perfusion, and no compliants indication adequate end
organ perfusion.  Pt remains hypotensive (SBP 80-90) even after
receiving 7L of IVFs, but likely was dehydrated prior to
presentation and has high insensible losses due to fever.  Pt
also reports a ""low"" blood pressure at baseline. The patient was
also given one dose of stress dose steriods, but was
discontinued in the AM after her random cortisol was 32.  The
patient was continued on IV ciprofloxacin and and was
transitioned to po cipro 500mg Q12 x 14 day course.  The
patient's urine grew E. Coli and sensitivities were pending.
The patient's blood pressure ranged between SBP 90-110 on
discharge.  Pt was afebrile, ambulating, eating po, and feeling
back to her baseline.
.
# Acute renal failure: The patient initial creatine was 1.1 and
stablized to 1.0 today.  Her baseline is around 0.7. This is
likely prerenal w/ combination of poor po intake, vomiting,
fever.
.
# Chronic hepatitis C infection: Stable, has not required
treatment.  LFT's were wnl.

Discharge Instructions:

It was a pleasure [**Last Name (un) 505**] care of you while you were in the
hospital.  You were admitted to [**Hospital1 18**] because of an infection in
your kidney.  You had a CT scan performed of your kidney and it
was consistent with a kidney infection.  You stayed in the ICU
because your blood pressure was low.  You were given fluids and
treated with antibiotics for your infection.  You improved with
these treatments and were able to go home on oral antibiotics.

Please follow the medications prescibed below.

Please follow up with the appoints made below.

Please call your PCP or go to the ED if you experience worsening
fevers, chills, pain with urination, nausea, vomiting, chest
pain, shortness of breath, back pain, or other worsening
symptoms.

***********
PCP:
[**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient should have a CBC and BP check tomorrow.  The
patient was hypotensive in ICU (not pressor dependent), but was
back to her baseline blood pressure at discharge and afebrile.
The patient's urine culture is growing E. Coli, but
sensitivities are not back.  Please call the ICU ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 506**])
to follow-up on sensitivies.  Additionally, the patient's CT
scan showed a hypodensity within the left upper pole, which may
be at risk for developing into an abscess. Close interval
followup is suggested. Imaging should be repeated if symptoms
worsen or recurrs after treatment.  The patient should be
continued for a 14 day course of antibiotics.

Service:  GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  On [**2112-6-5**] the patient had a
sudden onset of emesis in the morning with no associated
nausea, abdominal pain or change in bowel habits and is
passing flatus.  She also passed brown stool that day.  She
has had no signs of fevers or chills, or sick contacts or
recent travel.  Twenty years ago the patient had a similar
episode and by history she was told she had a gallbladder
problem, but she never had any treatment given.  She
presented to the Emergency Department with a fever of 104.4
and mildly tender right upper quadrant with negative [**Doctor Last Name 515**]
sign.  An ultrasound demonstrated multiple gallbladder stones
and a 1.4 cm stone in a 1.5 cm common bile duct.  No
intrahepatic ductal dilatation or gallbladder wall thickening
or pericholecystic fluid.  The patient received Levofloxacin
and Flagyl and was urgently seen by the ERCP fellow and taken
for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, which
demonstrated some gastritis and severely deformed major
papilla and 8 mm common bile duct with no stones and a
sphincterotomy was performed with drainage of clear bile.
The patient was then admitted to the Medical Service.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1.  Hypertension.  2.  Breast cancer

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The is a Russian immigrant who taught
English.  The patient does not use tobacco or alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient had a temperature of
100.6, heart rate of 62, blood pressure 153/60, respiratory
rate 22, saturation 92% on room air.  Pertinent physical
examination demonstrated a soft, mildly tender right upper
quadrant with no [**Doctor Last Name **] sign.  Normal rectal tone and guaiac
negative.

PERTINENT LABORATORY INFORMATION:  White blood cell count
4.4, PT 13.7, INR 1.3, total bilirubin was 0.4, ALT 34, AST
24, alkaline phosphatase 106.  Urinalysis negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was managed medically until the
[**4-10**], because the patient was refusing
cholecystectomy as was recommended.  However, on the [**4-10**] the patient was amenable to surgery, because of
persistent right upper quadrant soreness.  On [**6-10**] the
patient underwent an open cholecystectomy with a common bile
duct exploration and placement of T tube and intraoperative
cholangiogram.  The patient had some difficulty with
extubation, because of sedation and was transferred from the
[**Hospital Ward Name 516**] at [**Hospital1 69**] to the
[**Hospital Ward Name 517**] in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit.  The
following day on postoperative day one the patient was
extubated after being weaned off her Propofol without any
complications and was maintained NPO.  The patient remained
well throughout the afternoon in the Surgical Intensive Care
Unit and was transferred to the floor.

On the floor the patient did well.  Physical therapy consult
was acquired where she performed well, but was recommended
for rehabilitation.  She began tolerating clears and a
regular diet.  She remained afebrile and she had her Foley
discontinued.  The patient had her JP tube discontinued and
was appropriate for rehab by postoperative day four [**2112-6-14**].

The patient will follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 518**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 519**] in two
weeks and during the same visit had a T tube cholangiogram
performed prior to seeing Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**].  The patient will also go
to rehab for further physical therapy rehabilitation and
medical care.

Service:  GREEN GENERAL SURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 81-year-old elderly lady
underwent an open cholecystectomy and common bile duct
exploration for type I Mirizzi syndrome three weeks prior to
admission.  On [**2112-7-1**], one day prior to admission,
she had a normal T-tube cholangiogram without antibiotic
coverage.  She was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] in his office and
approximately two hours later removed the T-tube without
incident.  After the removal of the tube, the patient
developed progressive nausea and chills and right sided
abdominal pain as reported by her daughter.  She presented to
the [**Hospital6 256**] Emergency Department
hypotensive to 80s systolic and acidotic leading to
intubation and institution of pressor support.  Her white
count at the time of admission was 12 with a total bilirubin
of 3.6.  AST and ALT were both above 500 with an alkaline
phosphatase of 334.  Her amylase and lipase were both in the
normal range.

On examination at the time of admission, Mrs. [**Known firstname 524**]
[**Name (STitle) 525**] abdomen was soft with mild right upper quadrant
guarding.  CT examination showed no collection and a mildly
dilated common bile duct.  Ascending cholangitis secondary to
seeding at the time of cholangiogram with stricture at the
T-tube site with or without a retained stone was the
diagnosis.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Breast cancer
3.  High cholesterol
4.  Diabetes mellitus
5.  Hypothyroidism
6.  Multinodular goiter

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Breast lumpectomy in [**2103**] and a
thyroidectomy in [**2106**].

HOME MEDICATIONS:
1.  Atenolol
2.  Glyburide
3.  Synthroid
4.  Lipitor
5.  ASA

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2112-7-3**], Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for close
management of her respiratory, cardiovascular and infectious
status.  She was seen by the ERCP service/fellow and she
received an emergency MRCP for ascending cholangitis.  This
study showed altered papilla anatomy, dilated common bile
duct and question of common hepatic duct stricture.  There
was no small leak at the site of the cystic duct/T-tube
track.  The ERCP resulted in 10 cc of purulent aspirate and a
10 French x 8 cm stent was placed.  After this procedure,
Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] continued to be monitored closely in the
Intensive Care Unit where her cardiovascular status was
monitored using a Swan-Ganz catheter.

By hospital day #3, Mrs. [**Known lastname 526**] was showing clinical
improvement from her ascending cholangitis.  On this day, she
started to wean off the ventilator and her white count
declined to 5.7.  The rest of Mrs.[**Known lastname 527**] Surgical
Intensive Care Unit course was characterized by progressive
weaning from the ventilators and from dobutamine and other
medications used to support her cardiovascular status.
Intravenous antibiotics consisting of Flagyl, ceftriaxone and
ampicillin were continued.  The patient was extubated on [**7-7**] and on [**2112-7-9**] she was transferred to the
patient floor out of the Intensive Care Unit and placed on
Levaquin.  Her status continued to stabilize and improve on
the floor and her condition at the time of discharge was very
good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Very good

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Ascending cholangitis

Per consultation with the physical therapy service, discharge
of the patient to a rehabilitation center was suggested, as
the patient lived alone and would not be able to, at the time
of discharge, successfully complete all of her necessary
activities of daily life.

FOLLOW UP PLANS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 519**] and this should be done in two
weeks after discharge.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: The patient is an 88 year old female, resident at [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 553**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 554**] [**Hospital3 **], with medical history pertinent for
Parkinson's disease, Diabetes, and recent cornea transplant who
now presents with altered mental status.
Per last progress note from patient's PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] patient has been
in her usual state of health with exception of management of a
cervical vertebral fracture secondary to fall as well as plans
for a repat penetrating keratoplasty (corneal transplant) s/p
failed prior. The patient was at that time apparently at her
baseline and cleared for surgery. The patient underwent
penetrating keratoplasty on [**2119-3-30**] for indication of failed
graft without complication. The patient was seen by her
ophthalmologist on [**2119-4-4**] with impression that there was
moderate lid edema present suggestive of hypersensitivity but no
discharge to suggest infection. Polysporin was discontinued
(with concern for hypersensitivty per discussion with daughter)
and other meds (Pred 1% TID OS, Timolol 0.5% [**Hospital1 **] OU, Xalatan QHS
OS, Tobradex
[**Doctor Last Name **] OS QHS) continued.
The patient now presents form her [**Hospital3 **] with concern
for altered mental status. Only limited information is available
from available staff at [**Hospital3 400**], with report only that
patient was noted tonight to be acutely confused and ""not making
sense"". Per discussion with the patient's daughter, the patient
was in her usual state of health as early as yesterday morning,
looking well. Later in the day, the patient was reported to be
walking up and down the hallway, refusing to go to her room. The
patient was noted to be shivering and unsteady on her feet.
Recommendation was made that patient be sent to hospital for
further evaluation. Per discussion with daughter, the patient
has had prior episodes of confusion in setting of underlying
infetion, usually UTI.
.
ED Course: 98.4 -> 102.8 rectal, 186/84, 85, 20, 93% RA. Labs
notable for WBC 8.0, lactate 1.8. Not signed out, but per
nursing report and discussion a central line was attempted given
poor PIV access for which the patient received Haldol. No
documentation of dose is available, [**Name8 (MD) **] RN to RN signout this
was 5mg IV. Central line was not successfully placed and
ultimately a 22 PIV in the hand was obtained.
The patient had a negative UA, CXR without obvious infiltrate
although limited. Ophthalmology was not contact[**Name (NI) **] as [**Name (NI) **]
impression was that eye was not infected. LP was recommended by
ED but patients' daughter declined this. The patient was given
Azithromycin, Vancomycin, and Ceftriaxone empirically and is now
admitted to the medical service for ongoing care.
On arrival to floor patient is lethargic but wakes to voice. She
answers questions although requires repeat questioning at times
to wake her. Patient reports mild neck pain since having collar
removed, denies headache, chest pain, dyspnea, abdominal pain or
other localizing symptoms.

CT head [**4-5**]:
1. No acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute fracture.
2. Diffuse cerebral atrophy with moderate sulcal and ventricular
prominence.
3. Chronic microvascular infarcts, unchanged.
4. Paranasal sinus disease as described, likely acute in the
sphenoid sinus.

CT neck [**4-6**]:
1. Significant swelling/inflammation of the soft tissues at the
base of tongue, oropharynx, with fullness in the vallecula and
the piriform sinuses, overall resulting in moderate to marked
narrowing of the oropharynx. The etiology of this finding is
uncertain from the present study. To correlate with direct ENT
examination.
2. Fullness of the hypopharynx and adjacent portions of
esophagus - no adequately assessed on the present study- further
evaluation recommended.
3. Increased attenuation of the fat in the carotid space, with
soft tissue attenuation opacity, with heterogeneous appearance,
causing indentation on the right internal jugular vein extending
down along the carotid space, into the region of the thoracic
inlet. This may relate to inflammation, phlegmon, and
radiation-related changes if there is history of radiation in
the past and less likely neoplastic. Close followup evaluation,
with ultrasound can be considered to evaluate for any abscess,
given the patient's symptoms of fever.

CT orbits:
1. Increased attenuation of the preseptal soft tissues with some
enhancement, on the left side, likely due to inflamamtion/
post-surgical changes- correlate with clinical examination. No
definite abscess on the present set of images. No intraconal
abnormality. F/u as clinically indicated.
2. Moderate paranasal sinus disease

CT head [**4-9**]:
1. No acute intracranial process.
2. Persistent cerebral atrophy.
3. Chronic microvascular ischemic changes.
4. Paranasal sinus disease.

MRI/MRA brain:
Final Report
HISTORY: Parkinson's, delirium, lethargy, right facial droop and
dysarthria.
Evaluate for signs of intracranial hemorrhage or acute stroke.

Comparison is made to most recent head CT of [**2119-4-9**]

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were
obtained through
the brain without intravenous gadolinium. 3D time-of-flight MR
arteriography
was also performed. Volume-rendering reconstructed images were
evaluated.

MRI OF THE BRAIN AND MRA OF THE BRAIN: There is no evidence of
intracranial
hemorrhage, masses, mass effect, or regions of restricted
diffusion to suggest
acute infarction. A few scattered periventricular T2/FLAIR
hyperintensities
are noted, which are nonspecific but likely suggest chronic
small vessel
ischemia. There are also adjacent prominent Virchow-[**Doctor First Name **]
spaces. While
there is underlying global cerebral atrophy, the degree of
dilatation of the
ventricular system may be somewhat disproportionate to the
amount of central
atrophy. Small amount of fluid is noted in the mastoids
bilateral.

MR arteriography of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] displays no aneurysmal
dilatation.
Mild atherosclerosis is noted in the right M1 segment. Posterior
circulation
is left dominant.

IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of acute infarction. Scattered changes likely
related to
chronic small vessel ischemic disease.

2. Question slightly disproportionate degree of ventricular
dilatation in
relation to the amount underlying cerebral atrophy. While this
finding is
nonspecific, in the appropriate clinical scenario it may reflect
underlying
NPH.



Brief Hospital Course:
This pt is a 88yo female w h/o Parkinson's disease, mild
dementia and recent corneal transplant admitted to the hospital
for AMS and to the ICU for airway narrowing.
.
# Airway narrowing: She was noted to have swelling of the tongue
and lower lips on admission. A CT of the Head and Neck with IV
contrast showed no clear evidence of preseptal cellulitis and ?
of soft tissue infection/edema of neck and throat. Over course
of day, noted to have increased audible upper airway sounds with
good O2 sat of 97% on 2L which has been stable. ENT was
consulted and saw extensive edema and soft tissue swelling in
oropharynx with patent airway. Swelling around false cords,
tonsillar edema, but true cords without edema. The team thought
the swelling to be secondary to possible allergic reaction to
medications. She was started on solumedrol 60IV and famotidine
20mg. She was given one dose of zosyn and then switched to
unasyn to cover for possible soft tissue infection. Pt without
leukocytosis, fever (was 102.8 in the ED but afebrile since), or
abcess. ENT and anesthesia recommended transfer to ICU for
further monitoring. She was monitored and continued on Decadron
for three doses. During successive scopes by ENT, oropharyngeal
edema and some secretions were seen, but airway remained patent.
Unclear etiology: possible allergic reaction vs infectious
process vs both given tonsils appear possibly infectious and
lower airway appears more edematous and less infectious.
Lisinopril was stopped, and her laryngoscopic exam visibly
improved by the time she was called out to the floor.
-Pt was treated for 10 days for ?soft tissue infection and
switched to Augmentin for additional 5 days at dc
-ENT follow up appt was set up

# s/p corneal TP: lid edema on exam. Ophtho believes likely
secondary to blockage of drainage and not as likely due to
allergy.  Ophtho felt the eye was improving and recommended
decreasing doses of eye drops.
-FU appt with Optho set up
.
#. Altered Mental Status: On admission, she was lethargic,
possibly from the Haldol she received in the ED. By the time she
was called out of the ICU, she was likely at her baseline mental
status, pleasant and easily conversant. Shortely thereafter,
however, she became agitated and combative and received 1.5mg
Haldol and later the same day 5mg of Zyprexa. She remained
agitated for about 36 hours before she became lethargic and
barely arousable. Head CT was unchanged from before. She had not
had any new fevers or new signs of infection. She had a lumbar
puncture that was unremarkable. MRI/MRA was neg except for some
ventriculomegaly in setting of global atrophy which was
difficult to differentiate from NPH. Neurology thought it was
unlikely to be NPH. EEG showed some focal acitivity concerning
for sublinical seizures. Pt was started on keppra, initially
continued to have periods of somnolence along with R sided
facial droop (which was thought be Neurology to represent a
post-ictal state with [**Doctor Last Name 555**] paralysis) but day before discharge
had significant improvement in mental status and was alert and
conversive. Due to hx of dementia and also ongoing hypoactive
delirium, pt was not fully oriented but did have significant
improvement in level of alertness.
-Pt curently is on Keppra 1000mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week and to be
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] later and kept at that dose.
-Pt should be followed by a neurologist at [**Hospital 100**] Rehab
-Outpt FU w neurology is already set up
.

#. UTI: grew Enterococcus in UCx. She was continued on Unasyn
for 10 days.
.
#. Positive blood cultures: 1/4 bottles growing coag negative
Staph. This was likely a contaminant so vancomycin was stopped.
Repeat blood cultures were negative.

#. Parkinson's Disease: continued Sinemet except when patient
was too lethargic to safely take meds
.
#. Hypertension, benign: Lisinopril was stopped due to concern
of angioedema. Atenolol was continued.
.
#. Hyperlipidemia: continued statin
.

Service:  GU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was admitted on [**2141-7-4**], for a left nephrectomy and periaortic lymph node
dissection and cystoscopy secondary to diagnosis of
transitional carcinoma and a left renal mass. She was first
seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2141-5-12**], for an evaluation of an
episode of gross hematuria that was associated with an
enhancing soft tissue mass in the upper pole of the
infundibulum of the left kidney. This was diagnosed by CT on
[**2141-5-9**]. Now was confirmed by MRI and measured to be
3.3 cm. The patient was then scheduled for a left nephrectomy
and staging studies revealed that the right kidney was OK.
She has no history of UTIs, colon cancer, smoking or dysuria.
However, there is a positive family history for renal cell
cancer in her brother who is currently affected.

ALLERGIES:  She reports no known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Outpatient medications include Lipitor,
Norvasc, vitamins and aspirin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for questionable TIA which
gave her temporary memory loss. Her past medical history is
negative for a MI, angina, diabetes, colitis, COPD or any
thyroid disease.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Repair of a tendon in her right hand
in the remote past.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco and no drug use, but alcohol use
about 4 times a week.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Significant for a brother with renal cell
carcinoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs: Afebrile, vital signs
stable. General: She appears well and sitting comfortably.
HEENT: No masses. Chest: Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
CV: Normal sinus rhythm. Abdomen soft, nontender,
nondistended.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  She was admitted to the SICU on [**2141-7-4**], after her left nephrectomy, periaortic lymph node
dissection and cystoscopy. She did well postoperatively,
underwent no events in the SICU and was transferred to the
regular floor the following day on [**2141-7-5**]. She did well
on the floor. Her pain was well controlled and she was also
given Ancef for 3 doses. Chest x-ray in the SICU showed a 5
mm pneumothorax but the chest tube was pulled. The repeat
chest x-ray performed upon arrival to the floor was negative
for a pneumothorax. On [**2141-7-6**], postoperative day 2, the
patient continued to improve. She began to ambulate. Her NG
tube was discontinued. She was taken off telemetry. Yet, she
passed no gas, there was no flatus. Postoperative day 3, she
continued to improve and she continued to ambulate and still
awaiting return of bowel function. Postoperative day 4, her
abdomen was distended, slightly tympanitic. She was returned
to NPO, encouraged to ambulate, given PCA for her pain
control, and the results of her abdominal film were pending.
Her abdominal film came back negative. On [**7-9**],
postoperative day 5, she continued to do well and her diet
was advanced as tolerated after she passed gas and ambulation
was encouraged. Postoperative day 6, [**2141-7-10**], the
patient did very well in her whole hospital course, was doing
well in the morning and was discharged that evening. She was
given instructions to follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], as well as
appropriate pain medication and Colace.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 57M PMH HIV, h/o lymphoma in remission, GERD with grade III
esophagitis p/w acute UGIB and hypotension, admitted to the
MICU.
.
# UGIB: Initially hypotensive with SBP 60's as per HPI.
Received blood and fluid resuscitation (7 units PRBCs total this
admission; 2 were emergency crossmatch). Admitted to MICU.  EGD
[**6-12**] with the above results.  On [**6-13**] patient had reported
hematocrit drop from 27 to 18; received 2 units and subsequent
hematocrits >30 and stable (?erroneous value).  EGD was done
again in light of hematocrit drop, again showing esophagitis but
no other lesions. Last transfusion on [**2102-6-13**].  GI and surgery
followed patient during admission.  Source of bleed appeared to
be esophagitis, as no other upper lesions noted.  PPI was
continued with [**Hospital1 **] dosing and sucralfate started.  Patient was
also asked to avoid chloral hydrate (had been taking at home for
sleep), which can cause gastritis.
.
# Coag negative staph bacteremia. [**4-11**] cultures were positive
from [**6-12**], initially thought to perhaps be a contaminant but
further bottles then became positive. Started vanco on [**6-13**].
Patient with recent root canal and given amox; ?source.  TTE was
done without evidence of vegetation.  Given low suspicion of
endocarditis, TEE was not done.  Surveillance cultures were all
negative.  Planned to treat patient with a 14 day course of IV
vancomycin; midline placed.  However, prior to arrangements
being made for home IV antibiotics, then patient insisted on
leaving AMA.  Midline pulled and patient placed on suboptimal
regimen of levofloxacin PO x 14 days.  He was informed that his
treatment regimen was not ideal and could lead to persistent
bacteremia and associated poor outcomes, but refused to stay
until arrangements could be made (if they could be at all given
his insurance).
.
# Fungemia.  On [**2102-6-15**] PM, [**2-10**] blood cultures from [**2102-6-12**] turned
positive for budding yeast.  He was given a dose of caspofungin.
 Possible portal of entry from subclinical esophagitis and entry
to bloodstream during GI bleed.  The seriousness of fungemia was
discussed with him, as well as needs to continue IV antifungal
treatments.  As above, he insisted on leaving on [**2102-6-16**], against
medical advice.  He appeared to have good understanding of his
disease and its risks (patient also a former nurse) but felt
that further workup was unnecessary and he had had his mind set
on leaving that day.   Efforts to look for source sites were
attempted; he had CT torso (no evidence of source for his
fungemia).  Ophthalmology was also consulted for dilated eye
exam, to which he initially agreed but then refused once they
arrived.  He also refused to stay in house for ID consult.  As
above, with him leaving AMA and no home IV treatment possible,
he was discharged home on a planned 2 week course of
fluconazole.  Following discharge, blood cultures were followed
and the yeast was determined to be [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 564**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 563**] (high
resistance rates to fluconazole).  Both patient and PCP made
aware of this on [**2102-6-19**].  Per PCP and patient, planning for
very close followup over the next several weeks to include blood
cultures, daily temperature checks, etc.  Patient refused return
to the hospital for IV treatment and further workup.  Of note, 8
further bottles of blood cultures were negative (now final).
.
# Hypotension: SBP 60s on arrival; primarily hypovolemic with
?septic component as above.  Followup callout to the floor, his
SBP was in the low 90s but he was asymptomatic, not tachycardic.
SBPs recorded from outpatient notes generally ~110, but patient
reports BPs in 90's usually. Random cortisol in unit was 28.4.
.
# Leukocytosis: initially thought to be a stress response. Then
with 3/4 cultures positive for staph as above, also yeast as
above. CXR without infiltrate and UA negative.
.
# Delirium: Noted in the MICU in the setting of massive GIB and
bacteremia. The patient's baseline mental status per partner is
oriented x 3 but occasionally confused. Nonfocal neurologic
examination and once on medical floor he was back to baseline
per partner. [**Name (NI) **] last onc outpatient notes - increasing fatigue
and slurred speech.  Valium was held.
.
# Acute renal failure: Likely prerenal. Baseline creatinine
1.0-1.1.  Resolved.
.
# HIV: CD4 288, VL < 50 [**2102-5-15**]. Continued Atripla.
.
# Thrombocytopenia. Likely consumptive/dilutional given bleed
and resuscitation. Improved.
.
# Chronic pain: Chronic BLE pain thought due to zoster/MVA.
Continued lidocaine patch and amitriptyline.
.
# Depression: No active issues.  Continued effexor.
.
# Hypothyroidism: No active issues.  Continued levothyroxine.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: No active issues.  Continued lipitor.

Chief Complaint:
Respiratory Distress

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
BiPAP


History of Present Illness:
84M PMhx metastatic papillary thyroid CA (s/p resection,
radioactive iodine) c/b lung mets, found to have large cavitary
mass in RLL, recent admission with malignant effusion + for SCC
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna.  Prior
hospitalization was also notable for PET scan that revealed
widely metastatic disease.

He presents today from rehab with acute respiratory distress.
Pt is [**Name (NI) 595**] speaking so history was obtained from family.  At
baseline he is on 2L o2, yesterday he was doing well, but last
night he woke up in respiratory distress.  The rehab reported
that he was sating at 80% on a non-rebreather mask.  EMS was
called and he was transferred the the [**Hospital1 18**] ED.  Prior to event,
pt denies any fevers or chills, nausea, vomiting.  He has a
chronic cough secondary to his lung ca but the quality of the
cough did not change.  he is not experiencing any pain.

Of note, pt's recent PMH is notable for rapid progression of
metastatic lung SCC.  He started experiencing chronic cough and
hemoptysis in [**Month (only) 547**] and symptoms have progressed since.  In [**Month (only) 596**]
he was noted to have a large cavitary mass in RLL with satellite
nodules suggestive of primary lung Ca.

At the end of [**Month (only) **] he was admitted to osh with fever,
leukocytosis and cough and treated with ctx.  His  symptoms did
not improve.  At this time a CT showed cavitary lesion as above
and a new large r exudative pleural effusion.  Effusion
reaccumulated resulting in supplemental O2 requirement.  As such
a chest tube was placed and the cytology came back + for SCC.
He was started on vanc zosyn for obstructive pna and was
transferred to [**Hospital1 18**].  Hospital course was notable for r/o PE,
attempted pleurx catheter placement on [**6-27**] that failed due to
loculated effusions not amenable to pleurx.  At this point a PET
scan was done that showed extensive metastatic dz.

In the ED, initial VS were: t 98.1 80 106/46 80s on [**Last Name (LF) 597**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] he
was started on bipap 60 15/5 and his sats improved to 96%.  He
was noted to have bilaterally crackles throughout lung fields,
and a power picc was in place in right ac fossa.

CXR is consistent with prior xrays from earlier this month, but
RLL effusion appears to have expanded.  Labs were notable for
wbc of 38k with 94% N,  hct was 25 and platelets 504.  He was
given vanc and cefepine and transferred to the unit.

On arrival to the MICU, pt is somnolent, on bipap and sating in
the low 90s.  he is with his family and easily arousable.  He is
answering questions appropriately.  His family was concerned
that he has been over sedated since he last left [**Hospital1 18**].  The
report that he has been sleeping all day and are concerned that
he is receiving too much narcotics.  Apparently he was recently
started on a fentanyl patch 50mcg at rehab.

Brief Hospital Course:
84M history of metastatic papillary thyroid cancer (s/p
resection, radioactive iodine) complicated by lung metastases,
found to have large cavitary mass in RLL with recent admission
for malignant effusion positive for small cell lung cancer
recently treated for presumed post-obstructive pna that presents
with acute respiratory distress. His respiratory distress was
thought to be secondary to aforementioned metastatic disease. It
was discussed with family and patient that his disease was
terminal without many further options. He was stabilized on
biPAP. Goals of care discussion yielded to make the patient
comfort measures only. He expired at 11:55 AM on [**2118-7-11**] with
family at the bedside including his wife and son. [**Name (NI) 6**] autopsy was
declined. Given death was within 24 hours of admission, the
medical examiner was notified but declined the case for further
review. The etiology of death was respiratory distress from lung
cancer.

[**2101-8-15**] CT Abd/pelvis :
High grade small bowel obstruction with dilated proximal loops
and decompressed distal loops with a transition point likely at
the site of right femoral hernia.


Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 349**] was evaluated by the Acute Care team in the
Emergency Room and based on her physical exam and abdominal CT
she was admitted to the ICU for IV hydration, gastric
decompression and monitoring of her renal failure with operative
repair once she is fluid resuscitated.  Her creatinine was 2.2
on admission then decreased to 1.7 after 24 hours.

On [**2101-8-16**] she was taken to the Operating Room and underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with appendectomy and repair of her right
femoral hernia.  She tolerated the procedure well and returned
to the PACU in stable condition.  She maintained stable
hemodynamics and her pain was minimal.  She was transferred to
the Surgical floor and continued to make slow progress.  Her
abdominal wound was healing well and she worked with Physical
Therapy to increase her mobility.

Her diet was slowly advanced but she had problems with emesis
and it took quite a bit of time for her bowel function to
resume. Erythromycin and Reglan were started as pro motility
agents but she developed diarrhea with these and they were
stopped. Stool for C. difficile was sent and came back negative.
At baseline she has a limited appetite and was started on
Marinol as an appetite stimulant with significant improvement in
her appetite.

Her abdominal staples were removed on [**8-29**]. She is being
recommended for rehab and is being discharged from the hospital
after an extended stay following her surgery.

Chief Complaint:
hypercarbic respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation [**2101-11-1**]
A line insertion [**2101-11-2**]
PICC line [**2101-11-2**]

History of Present Illness:
[**Age over 90 **]F w/hx of COPD on 2L at baseline for last day has had increase
O2 requirement. Per husband/rehab has increased O2 requirement
over the last day. Coughing decreased from COPD baseline. Yest
was hypoxic and NC uptitrated to 5L. This AM requiring NRB (sats
and circumstances unclear). [**Name2 (NI) **] has been afebrile but has
had increasing LE edema.

Per husbands report, had not been on home O2 for COPD until
placed in rehab in [**Month (only) 205**]. Had been living at home and very
functional until recent admission in [**Month (only) 205**] for N/V/Abd
distension. Had a laparotomy and appendix taken and out R
femoral hernia repaired. D/ced to rehab and has been there
since. Husband reports that roughly a week ago she had a
worsening cough and he thought she had developed bronchitis.
From the rehab charts it appears she was put on a prednisone
taper and azithromycin. He reports she had been improving with
these treatments until the last 2 days, although his history of
her worsening is very unclear. [**Name2 (NI) **] ED signout from talking to
the nursing home she was more hypoxic yesterday requiring 5L NC
and being placed on a NRB this AM. He reports she was
complaining of no other symptoms but is unclear if there was any
change in her mental status.

He reports that at home baseline before rehab she was able to
talk roughly 50yds before being limited by shortness of breath.
She did all the chores, cooking, and cleaning at the house per
his report and they went out together 3x/week. Since her
admission to the hospital and discharge to rehab, he reports she
had not done as well, but again his history is somewhat unclear.

ED Course, presented with Temp 98.4, HR 96, BP 118/54, RR 44,
Sats 100% on NRB. Altered here, A&O x 1, husband (also in 90s)
says she is fine at rehab baseline. Rales bilateral bases with
JVD at mandible. CXR showed bilateral pleural effusions with
infiltrated on RLQ and concern for aspiration. WBC elevated to
17.3 (89% PMNs without bands, Bcx drawn, and started on
vanco/zosyn. EKG: NSR at 94, NA/NI, No ST elevations. Given
combivent trial with 125mg IV methlyprednisone. Initial Chem 7
with HCO3 of 42, BNP of 1700. Initial VBG on NRB showed 7.23 /
112 / 55 / 49. Trialed on BiPAP with ABG showing 7.18 / 138 /
209 / 54. Pt wasn't tolerating BiPAP and kept taking off. Resp
rate high but other VSS. ED called PCP and daughter as pt had
DNR order but no DNI order and husband wanting everything done.
Daughter and PCP decided to intubate and see how things go with
thought that would withdraw care if dosen't recover. Easy
intubation. Intubated with succinylcholine and propofol. After
intubation and propofol BPs dropped to 80s/60s, given 1L NS and
switched to Midazolam and Fentanyl. Did not require pressors and
BPs came up to 110-120s. No CVL placed (2 PIV). Yellowish fluid
from lungs after intubation (unclear when was aspirating - with
intubation vs yest).

VS on ICU arrival now: Afebrile, BP 106/51, HR 81, RR 20, 98% on
100% FiO2 on Vent. Pt unable to respond to questioning and so no
ROS could be obtained.

IMAGING:
[**2101-11-1**] CXR
IMPRESSION: Limited study. Small bilateral pleural effusions
with patchy
opacities in the lung bases, which are nonspecific, and may
reflect
aspiration, infection, or atelectasis.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Evaluation of the study is limited due to technique, also the
patient's chin obscures the apices of the lungs. Allowing this
limitation, the ET tube is against the right tracheal wall. NG
tube is in the stomach. Cardiomegaly is stable. Bilateral
pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis have increased. The
upper lungs are hyperinflated.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
Comparison to prior chest radiograph for PICC line is now seen
up until the subclavian on the right vein on the right side is
not seen any further than that point. The rest of the chest
radiograph is unchanged from prior and extremely difficult to
interpret secondary to patient positioning.

[**2101-11-2**] CXR
IMPRESSION: AP chest compared to [**11-1**] and 28:
Right PIC line passes into the right neck, where the tip
position is unclear, but at least 4 cm above the thoracic inlet.

Nasogastric tube passes to the distal stomach and out of view.
Heart size is top normal. Small bilateral pleural effusions have
improved since earlier in the day, but there is no suggestion of
new consolidation at the right lung base which could be
pneumonia and warrants careful followup.

[**2101-11-3**] CXR
FINDINGS: Exam is limited by kyphotic positioning of the
patient, resulting in obscuration of the lung apices and
superior mediastinum. Endotracheal tube remains in place with
tip at approximately the thoracic inlet level. Nasogastric tube
courses below the diaphragm. Cardiomediastinal contours are
unchanged in appearance. Persistent bibasilar opacities, likely
a combination of pleural effusions and provided history of
aspiration pneumonia. Tip of right PICC has been withdrawn and
now terminates in the right axilla.

[**2101-11-5**] CXR
AP chest radiograph:
The study is suboptimal given the rotated position of the
patient and his neck being in extreme flexion and the head
overlying the lung apices. Within those limitations, the ET tube
tip appears to be close to the carina, approximately 1 cm above
it and reposition might be considered.
The NG tube tip passes below the diaphragm, most likely
terminating in the
stomach. Bilateral pleural effusions and bibasilar atelectasis
is
redemonstrated.

[**2101-11-9**] CXR: FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**11-5**], the
head of the patient greatly obscures the upper lungs.
Endotracheal tube is not definitely seen.
Continued enlargement of the cardiac silhouette with bilateral
effusions and bibasilar atelectasis. Central catheter from the
right appears to extend to at least the lower portion of the
right atrium.

[**2101-11-10**] CXR: FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph,
there is no relevant
change. Technically problem[**Name (NI) 115**] examination. Evidence of
moderate
cardiomegaly with retrocardiac atelectasis and small bilateral
pleural
effusions. Unchanged position of the right PICC line.


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Age over 90 **] y/o F with severe underlying COPD admitted with hypercarbic
respiratory failure due to pneumonia and COPD exacerbation. Her
course was notable for MICU admission requiring intubation and
succesful extubation. Her floor course was c/b heart failure,
metabolic disarray, and persistent high oxygen requirement and
work of breathing. The patient elected to make her code status
DNR/DNI/No NIPPV and unfortunately her respiratory function
continued to deteriorate over her hospitalization and she
ultimately passed away.

#Hypercarbic Respiratory Failure/COPD/Pneumonia/Acute-on-chronic
diastolic heart failure/Hypernatremia:
Patient was admitted to the MICU after intubation in the ED for
hypercarbic respiratory failure that did not improve with NIPPV.
She was felt to have pneumonia on top of a severe COPD
exacerbation and was initially treated broadly with Vancomycin,
Levaquin, and Cefepime as well as steroids and bronchodilators.
Her antibiotics were narrowed to Levaquin and the patient was
able to be extubated. She was also diuresed with improvement in
her symptoms. She was extubated and transferred to the floor but
had persistent oxygen requirement requiring 50% O2 by face mask
to maintain oxygen saturation in the low 90s. She was noted to
be volume overloaded but diuresis was complicated by
hypernatremia requiring intermittent free water repletion and
hypokalemia with runs of NSVT on telemetry and paroxysms of
atrial tachycardia to the 150s. She was maintained on
levofloxacin and steroids, given morphine as needed for symptoms
of dyspnea, and diuresed but did not improve.  Over the last 3
days of her hospitalization she slowly declined with worsening
respiratory status, increased work of breathing, and more
frequent episodes of somnolence and confusion.

#Goals of care:
Given the severity of both acute and underlying illness,
Palliative care was consulted and the overall poor outlook was
discussed with the patient, her husband, and her children. The
patient expressed that she did not want CPR or intubation and
did not want non-invasive ventilation. On [**2101-11-10**] AM the patient
had significant respiratory distress marked by tachypnea,
altered mental status, and evidence of volume overload on exam.
She was diuresed and given more aggressive nebulizers and her
antibiotics were expanded, but she continued to decline and
ultimately passed away on the morning of [**2101-11-10**]. Her family and
PCP were notified.

findings are similar.

Brief Hospital Course:
82 y/o M history of HTN found with respiratory distress
requiring bipap, hypertension, and newly noted to be in new
atrial fibrillation.
.
#Respiratory distress/SOB: The patient's shortness of breath was
felt to be due to a combination of heart failure and COPD
exacerbation, discussed separately below. There was also concern
for possible pneumonia on initial CXR, but the patient remained
afebrile, and follow-up CXR showed no infiltrate. At the time of
discharge, the patient was able to maintain good oxygenation
saturations with ambulation on room air.
.
#Acute on chronic diastolic heart failure: The patient presented
with shortness of breath. Cardiac enzymes were negative. He was
initially treated with lasix, bipap, and nitro gtt, although he
did not appear grossly volume overloaded. As his respiratory
status improved, he was transitioned to oral furosemide. TTE
showed preserved systolic function, and was unchanged from prior
study.
.
#COPD exacerbation: The patient presented with shortness of
breath and diffuse wheezing in the setting of a smoking history.
He was noted to have symbicort on his medication list but was
not taking this currently. He was given azithromycin x 5 days,
nebulizers, and was started on a prednisone taper. The plan for
the remainder of the taper is as follows: 20 mg daily [**Date range (1) 604**],
10 mg daily [**Date range (1) 605**], 5 mg daily [**Date range (1) 606**]. Symbicort and
Spiriva were started. The patient was urged to stop smoking.
.
#Atrial fibrillation, with rapid ventricular response: The
patient was found to be in atrial fibrillation, which is a new
diagnosis for him. He had rapid ventricular response, treated
with metoprolol, with improvement in heart rate. Metoprolol was
uptitrated to 300 mg daily. The patient's CHADS score is 3.
Anticoagulation was recommended to the patient and his family,
and the patient elected to defer this decision for now and
discuss with his primary care doctor.
.
#Hypertension: The patient was noted to have BP of 200/100 by
EMS. It is unclear if his marked hypertension was a cause of his
shortness of breath (flash pulmonary edema), or a consequence of
his respiratory distress. The patient's blood pressure rapidly
improved. The patient's home amlodipine, hydralazine, and
isosorbide monotitrate were continued. Furosemide was initially
given IV, then convered back the patient's home dose. Metoprolol
was increased to metoprolol succinate 300 mg dialy in the
setting of Afib with rapid vemtricular response. Clonidine was
changed to twice daily dosing (0.1 mg [**Hospital1 **]).
.
#Elevated lactate: The patient had lactate 5.4 on presentation.
This rapidly downtrended to 1.6. There was no evidence of
hypoperfusion. The elevated lactate may have been related to
increased work of breathing in the setting of respiratory
distress, although the rapidity of the resolution (normalizing
in <2 hours) also raises the possibility that the initial
lactate was a spurious laboratory value.
.
#Eosinophilia: Patient with 7.8% eosinophils out of WBC 8.2. On
review of past laboratory date, it is apparent that this is a
chronic process.
.
#Chronic kidney disease, stage II: Creatinine was 1.3 on
admission, which is the patient's baseline. Creatinine increased
slightly to 1.6 with diuresis and subsequently remained stable
at 1.5-1.6.
.
#Transitional issue: The patient will complete his prednisone
taper and follow up in primary care and pulmonology for further
management of his dyspnea. Visiting nursing was arranged to
assist the patient with medications.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with difficulty breathing. You were
initially admitted to the intensive care unit. You were treated
with steroids and inhalers, with improvement in your breathing.
You were also treated with diuretics for heart failure.
.
You were found to have an irregular heart rhythm called atrial
fibrillation. You had some rapid heart rates. Due to this, your
metoprolol was increased, with some improvement in your heart
rate.
.
Atrial fibrillation places you at an increased risk for stroke.
You can decrease this risk by taking blood thinning medications.
We discussed the risks and benefits of blood thinning
medications, and you decided that you wanted to defer this
decision for now and speak with your primary care doctor.
.
We have arranged follow-up with your primary care doctor and
with a lung doctor (pulmonologist). See below for details.
.
You need to stop smoking. It is making your lung disease worse.
.
Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more
than 3 lbs.
.
There are some changes to your medications:
1. CHANGE clonidine to 0.1 mg twice daily.
2. START metoprolol succinate 300 mg daily. This is a more
long-acting form of metoprolol that you will take daily instead
of metoprolol tartrate (short-acting form). You will start
metoprolol succinate tomorrow morning [**2191-5-15**]. For tonight
[**2191-5-14**], you will take one metoprolol tartrate 100 mg pill
(given to you by the hospital to take home).
3. STOP ibuprofen as this can cause kidney problems in patients
with high blood pressure.
4. START Symbicort (budesonide-formoterol) inhaler.
5. START Spiriva (tiotropium) inhaler
6. START prednisone taper, as follows:
   20 mg (2 tablets) daily [**Date range (1) 604**]
   10 mg (1 tablet) daily [**Date range (1) 605**]
   5 mg (half tablet) daily [**Date range (1) 606**]

Chief Complaint:
transferred for seizures

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
intubation



History of Present Illness:
86y M with PMH significant for HTN, CAD s/p CABG, afib (now on
warfarin), stroke 2y ago, and a seizure disorder on Keppra
(previously seen in clinic by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 619**]. atrial
fibrillation on Coumadin. who presents with left ear pain. He
presented to the OSH ED ([**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**]) 1wk PTA with CC: ear pain.
He was sent home with Dx of cerumen in external canal. His ear
pain continued and this past Friday his PCP prescribed [**Name9 (PRE) 621**] gtt
for presumed otitis externa. Per his son, he developed
progressive confusion and imbalance. He became unable to walk,
and became more somnolent.

He returned to the ED at [**Hospital1 **]-[**Location (un) 620**] in the evening of [**2158-2-13**]
(1d
prior to transfer here), where his VS were notable for fever to
102.2F (after arriving afebrile) and tachycardia (normalized
with
1.5 L IVF), and exam was notable for somnolence. His WBC was
elevated at 14.9. INR was 3.3. Dig 0.84. Troponin negative. UA
""negative"" and CBC/BMP/LFTs reportedly unremarkable/wnl. A NCHCT
showed *Left mastoiditis*. He was given a dose of IV Zosyn. ENT
was consulted, and recommended admission for surgical Tx the
following morning and switching to CTX (2gm IV) for mastoiditis
Tx. He was given his evening dose of warfarin after clearance
from ENT, with a plan for ENT surgery and ID consultation in the
morning.

However, around 6:00am the morning after admission ([**2157-2-14**]), the
patient had a GTC seizure requiring 12mg IV lorazepam to stop.
He
was loaded with 1gm of IV phenytoin and his levetiracitam was
increased to 1500mg [**Hospital1 **] (from his home dose of 750mg [**Hospital1 **]). He
was
intubated and maintained on a propofol gtt on and off. His
post-ictal exam was notable for spontaneous movements of all
four
extremities, but lack of eye opening/arousability. A Neurologist
there saw the patient, but his notes are not immediately
available to me. His HCT was repeated after the seizure, and a
very tiny focus of hemorrhage (hyperintensity) was seen at the
posterior end of the Left lateral ventricle (~trigone). There
was
also also a call of hyperintensity in the interpeduncular fossa
(which would, if true, suggest subarachnoid blood, but on
reviewing the images I think this is an overcall). Finally,
there
was a large hypodensity in the Right temporal lobe, which looks
old, and could be the ""old stroke"" seen on MRI in [**2156**] on OSH
workup in [**State 622**] for his only previous GTC seizure (see PMH,
below).

The OSH physicians thought he may have hemorrhagic conversion of
an acute stroke in the Right temporal lobe (despite a lack of
any
evidence for this on the NCHCT), and held his warfarin, which
was
a good idea anyway because he had a supratherapeutic INR at the
time of 3.7. After discussing the case with a Neurologist here
at
[**Hospital1 18**], they decided to hold off on reversing his coagulopathy
with vitamin K or FFP. They continued his statin.

Regarding his infectious and other general medical
workup/treatment, he had [**4-17**] BCx bottles return positive for GPC
in pairs. The cultures were repeated post-antibiotics. A TTE was
obtained out of concern for septic cerebral embolus, and it did
not show valvular vegitations, but did show several
thickened/diseased valves. TEE was considered, but not done. He
was given a couple liters of IVF for decreased urine output (and
urine was dark on arrival here). He was continued on his digoxin
(level y/d was 0.86), and his home BB and CCB were held. He was
doing just find on MV/CMV with ABG of 7.39/35/174 and an
unremarkable CXR. They did not start tube feeds.

Pertinent Results:
Current Labs:

WBC 6.2 Hb 11.4 HCT 34.6 Plt 161
Na 139 K 4.8 Cl 109 CO2 22 BUN 23 Cr 0.6 Glu 108
INR 1.4

EEG ([**2-15**]): This is an abnormal routine EEG due to the presence
of a
poorly maintained 6.5 Hz background which appeared only briefly
and due
to generalized delta slowing which predominated the record. This

represents a mild to moderate encephalopathy. It is also
abnormal due
to the presence of right temporal slowing and lower voltage
activitiy
which indicate focal subcortical dysfunction. Occasionally, left

fronto-temporal broad-based sharp waves were seen although they
were not
clear spikes, but may indicate a propensity to focal cortical
irritability. If the clinical suspicion for seizures is high,
prolonged
bedside EEG monitoring may helpful for further diagnosis

MR head: No acute infarction; Redemonstration of susceptibility
and fluid-fluid layering within the bilateral occipital [**Doctor Last Name 534**]
consistent with a scant amount of intraventricular hemorrhage;
Opacification of the left mastoid which given the central
diffusion abnormality may represent acute mastoiditis as there
is no evidence that this is chronic, recommend clinical
correlation.

CT abd ([**2-20**]):  Multiple dilated loops of small bowel with no
discrete transition point and an uncomplicated small
bowel-containing left inguinal hernia, most likely represent
ileus or enteritis

CT head ([**3-3**]): No acute abnormality is seen. Old right temporal
lobe infarction


Brief Hospital Course:
[**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 627**] is an 86-year-old man with a complicated past
medical history that includes hypertension, hyperlipidemia,
coronary artery disease status post
CABG in [**2143**], atrial fibrillation on Coumadin with a prior
stroke and right temporoparietal encephalomalacia, history of
small-bowel obstruction with a partial colectomy, temporary
colostomy, and subsequent reanastomosis, who was initially
admitted to [**Hospital3 **] [**Hospital3 628**] for a complaint of jaw
pain and subsequent mastoiditis.  There, he was started on
antibiotics and ultimately sustained a prolonged seizure
requiring intubation.  He was then subsequently transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] and spent the first several
days of his admission in the trauma ICU.

Seizures: He has had known seizure disorder since [**2156**] and was
treated by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 629**] on Keppra 750 [**Hospital1 **]. At the OSH he
had another GTC in the setting of lowering his AED to 250 [**Hospital1 **]
and a fever (unknown origin). He was at the time complaining of
ear pain, and ENT had planned a procedure at the outside
hospital, but he ended up seizing and requiring 12 mg Ativan
which necessitated intubation and transfer to [**Hospital1 18**]. He had been
loaded with Dilantin and Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]. He
had a routine EEG performed on arrival that showed him to be
encephalopathic. At that point he was taken off of the dilantin
and continued on Keppra. He had MR imaging of his head to make
sure there was no new process contributing to his change in
status; MR imaging (including MRI/A/V) was normal. He remains on
Keppra and has been seizure free while on the floor.

Ear Pain: ENT was consulted regarding his MRI finding of
opacification in the left mastoid. He had Strep pneumoniae
otitis media and mastoiditis complicated by bacteremia. ENT felt
the opacification was a chronic inflammation and that no surgery
was indicated at this time.

Fevers: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] had 2 culture bottles from OSH that grew
Streptococcus. He had no LP performed as it was felt that the
risk of reversing his anticoagulation was greater than the risk
of empirically treating him for a meningitis. ID consult was
obtained and they suggested a TEE which was performed that
showed no cardiac vegetations. He had urine cultures, blood
cultures, and sputum cultures that were all negative. A BAL
culture grew only Commensal Respiratory Flora. He was started on
Vancomycin, Cefepime and Flagyl for his strep bacteremia and
fevers and continued on this therapy until [**2-24**]. This was then
changed to Ceftriaxone 2gm Q24h for 4 more days to complete a 2
week course of abx for Strep pneumo bacteremia. He has currently
completed all of his antibiotics and has remained afebrile.

Ileus: During hosptialization, he developed loose stools and
abdominal distention. C. diff negative.  Seen by surgery
service. KUB and CT scan suggestive of an ileus.  No transition
point on CT scan to suggest SBO.  He had NG placed to wall
suction for decompression. This is now improved and his diet has
been advanced.

Atrial Fibrillation: Mr. [**Name13 (STitle) 630**] was on coumadin for his Afib. It
was held on day 1 of his hospitalization as it was
supratherapeutic at 3.3 and there was concern of a small area of
intraventricular hemorrhage. He was restarted on anticoagulation
with one day of heparin bridging when he was unable to take PO
medications.

HTN: Amlodipine changed to 10mg daily.

Wound Care: He was found to have sacral coccyx tissue breakdown
as was seen by wound care. Determined to be severe fungal rash
related fecal incontinence, no
pressure related breakdown. He has been on Miconazole powder.
New wound care recs will sent with discharge paperwork.

Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Confused - sometimes.
Level of Consciousness: Lethargic but arousable.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - requires assistance or aid (walker
or cane).


Discharge Instructions:
  You presented to a hospital with a generalized tonic clonic
seziure in the setting of a lowered AED dose and a fever. You
received 12 mg Ativan to stop the seizure and required
intubation for airway protection; you were then transfered to
[**Hospital1 18**] ICU for further management. You were loaded with Dilantin
and your Keppra was increased to 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]. Your current dose
of Keppra remains at 1000 mg [**Hospital1 **]
  You were seen by ENT service regarding your opacification in
the left mastoid noted on MRI. They felt that this was chronic
inflammation and no current intervention was reccommended at
this time.
  For your fevers, cultures from the outside hospital grew
streptococcus. Antibiotics were started for strep bacteremia and
you completed a 2 week course. Repeat cultures here were
negative.
  During hospitalization, you were having abdominal pain and
distention; there was concern for a small bowel obstruction so
you were seen by the surgery service. No surgical intervention
was necessary, but you did receive a NG tube for decompression.
This was likely an ileus and did improve. You are now able to
tolerate an oral diet.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 634**] is a 47 year old af am female with past medical
history of thyroid cancer s/p
thyroidecomy and RAI 20 years ago who presented with bloody
emesis after nausea and vomiting and noted to have severe
thrombocytopenia to 5. Initially managed in ICU with IVIG and
PLT transfusion, then transferred to the floor where a diagnosis
of ITP was made.
.
# Thrombocytopenia: Most likely due to immune thrombocytopenic
purpura.  Differential includeed aspartame induced
thrombocytopenia from her hawaiin cool aid, infections (HIV or
HepC) induced thromboyctopenia.  Peripheral smear without
shistocytes argued against TTP.  Normal coagulopathy. No new
medications to suspect cause of thrombocytopenia . In the ICU,
the patient was started on IV solumedrol 125 mg and gave 1 unit
of platelets.  PLT increased to 44 then trended back down, so pt
was started on IVIG.  No signs of active bleeding with stable
Hct. Pt was transitioned IV steroids to prednisone 100 mg po
qdaily (1mg/kg).   Checked HIV ab and HepC ab, HCV VL, HIV VL
(all negative).  After transfer from ICU, pt was continued on PO
Prednisone 1mg/kg, and PLTs trended up, and on discharge were
88.  On day of discharge Pt was at her home functional baseline,
tolerating a full diet, moving her bowels, and urinating.  There
were no s/s of bleeding. She was discharged on a regimen of 50mg
prednisone [**Hospital1 **] (pt preference to take [**Hospital1 **] rather than 100mg
daily).. Taper will be directed by hematology. She was
instructed to follow up for serial CBC monitoring. ITP could
have been promoted by H.pylori, see below.
++++ Pt should continue bactrim for PCP [**Name9 (PRE) **] as well as calcium
and vitamin D for bone health while on prednisone therapy.
.
# HEMATEMESIS/UGIB: Differential includes [**Doctor First Name **] [**Doctor Last Name **] tear
complicated by thrombocytopenia vs peptic ulcer disease vs
variceal bleeding vs gastitits vs dieulafoy's lesion, no history
of NSAID use. Initially managed in ICU. HCT and hemodynamically
stable during entire admission. Pt never experienced any
evidence of GIB during admission. HPylori test done and was
positive. Pt was started on triple therapy of Omeprazole PO,
Clarithromycin 500mg [**Hospital1 **], and Amoxicillin 1g [**Hospital1 **] x 14 days.  We
recommended the patient to follow up with GI for an EGD
.
#leukocytosis-likely a result of steroid use. No signs of
infection noticed during admission. Would monitor CBC after
discharge.
.
## TRANSITIONAL
- Discuss with your PCP about EGD to definitively evaluate for
cause of hematemesis and to evaluate for PUD.
- Discuss with Hematology regarding Prednisone taper/dosing
- Monitor your blood glucose since you are now on Prednisone.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [**Known lastname 634**],

Thank you for choosing [**Hospital1 18**]. You were admitted for vomiting
blood in the setting of a very low platelet count due to ITP
(""immune thrombocytopnia""). You were stabilized in the Intensive
Care Unit with platelet transfusion, Intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG), and steroids.  With these interventions your platelet
count increased so you are safe for discharge home with
Hematology follow-up.  Please have outpatient blood tests done
in 3 days (on Friday [**8-14**]) to check your platelets, which will
be followed up by Hematology.  You have been given a lab slip
for this.

The cause of your initial vomiting and blood are unclear.  [**Name2 (NI) **]
might have had a viral illness causing wretching, resulting in a
small esophageal tear.  But it is also possible that you could
have peptic ulcers, which could be supported byt the fact that a
tests suggested that you have H.pylori, a bacteria which can
cause ulcers.  You should complete a 2 week course of
antibiotics/acid suppressors in order to eliminate this bacteria
(Amoxicillin, Clarithromycin, and Omeprazole).  In addition, you
should have an EGD (upper endoscopy), which has been scheduled
for you.

While on the antibiotics, you should be aware they can cause
side effects of easy sun burn, interactions with alcohol, and
birth defects. Please avoid the sun and use sunblock, minimize
or avoid alcohol consumption, and use two methods of
contraception.

MEDICATIONS
- Start Prednisone (this medication will be tapered down based
on your discussion at your upcoming Hematology appointment)
- Start Omeprazole, Amoxicillin, and Clarithromycin for 2 weeks

oriented to self, age, month, year, place.  He had severe
dysarthria but with normal naming, repetition and
comprehension.  He had marked neglect of the left
initially and only limited insight into his weakness.  Cranial
nerves: His pupils were equally
reactive from 4-2 mm bilaterally.  No relative ABT.
Extraocular movements full.  Visual fields were intact to
confrontation.  He had a severe left central facial droop.
Sensation was decreased in V1, V2, and V3.  His palate moved
symmetrically.  His shoulder shrug was 5 out of 5.  Tongue
was midline.  Motor:  Left arm was flat and 0 out of 5 motor
strength.  His left leg exhibited 2 out of 5 motor strength.
His right arm and leg were both 5 out of 5 strength.  He had
increased tone in the left upper extremity.  Sensory:  No
response on the left arm, face and leg.  The right side was
normal.  Deep tendon reflexes were brisk on the left, 2+ on
the right.  The left toe was upgoing.  The right toe was
downgoing.  Coordination testing was intact to
finger-to-nose-to-finger on the right.  He was unable to be

LABORATORY DATA:  Admission labs included a CBC with a white
count of 8.9, hematocrit 41, platelet count 240; INR 1.1, PTT
26.4; sodium 135, BUN 18, creatinine 1.1, glucose 113, CK
256, troponin less than 0.3, MB 3.

Labs from [**1-25**] showed [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor First Name **] positive at 1-180 with a
speckled pattern; double-stranded DNA was pending; Rheumatory
factor was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neuromedicine Service.  The stroke attending was called and
was present within 15 min of the patient's arrival to the
Emergency Department.  TPA was prepared but not given, as the
patient seemed to have a hemorrhage while in MR scanning.
MRI was reviewed with the stroke attending and discussed with
the Neurosurgery resident on call.

Dr. ..................., his primary care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
[**Name (NI) 653**], as well as the patient's son and his wife.

The MR [**First Name (Titles) 654**] [**Last Name (Titles) 655**] hemorrhage in the temporal lobe
on the right side with ventricular
extension into the right frontal lobe.  There was no evidence
of a mass or aneurysm on MRA.  The patient was admitted to
the Neuromedicine Intensive Care Unit for further management
at that time.

On [**2-13**], angiogram was performed which showed no
evidence of arterial venous malformation or fistula.  A
repeat CT showed increased signs of the area affected by the
hemorrhage which was likely due to redistribution of the
bleed, but there was no new blood seen on the scan.  The
bleed extended further into the right frontal cortex.  The
patient was started on Dilantin for prevention of seizures.

On [**2-14**], Speech and Swallow evaluation was performed,
and it was suggested that the patient have only honey-thick
liquids; however, he did not tolerate this well in the
Intensive Care Unit, as he was choking on these at the
bedside, and he was kept NPO from then on.

On [**2-15**], ................... returned showing
..................  ....................  At this point, it
was considered most likely that his bleed was secondary to
amyloid angiopathy.  Speech and Swallow evaluation was
repeated at the bedside on [**2125-2-16**], which showed
him to have decrease in his ability to swallow at this time.

The patient was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit to
the floor of Far Five on [**2125-2-16**].  There was very
little change in his exam over the next two days; however, on
the 24th, it was noted that he had small contractions with
effort in his left hamstring and abductor, as well as
response to cold on that side.  He was also better able to
form sounds, ""ga, ma and la"" with less dysarthria.

Repeat swallow study was performed which showed remarkable
improvement with him having difficulty only with swallowing
pills.  He was therefore placed back on a soft diet with
clear liquids and crushed pills and apple sauce.

His left-sided neglect continually was improving with much
effort from both the patient and his wife, reminding him pay
more attention to his right side.

On [**2-20**], bilateral lower extremity Dopplers were
obtained and showed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis.

EIA.

=======================================

EGD ([**2132-4-9**])
Old blood and clots were seen throughout stomach. Copious
irrigation of clots was performed. There were multiple punctate
areas of red blood in the fundus. These were washed and were not
actively bleeding.
Other findings: Significant erythema was noted in the duodenum
c/w duodenitis. Duodenum was carefully inspected and no ulcer
was seen. Scope was advanced to D3 where bile was seen.
Impression: Old blood and clots were seen throughout stomach.
Copious irrigation of clots was performed. There were multiple
punctate areas of red blood in the fundus. These were washed and
were not actively bleeding.
Significant erythema was noted in the duodenum c/w duodenitis.
Duodenum was carefully inspected and no ulcer was seen. Scope
was advanced to D3 where bile was seen. Otherwise normal EGD to
second part of the duodenum

Recommendations: No active bleeding was seen. Bleeding may have
been due to punctate areas in fundus, gastritis, or unseen
[**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **] or ulcer, although no definitive cause was found.
IV PPI twice daily.
Serial hct; transfuse as needed.
Patient will need outpatient H. Pylori testing with either
breath test or stool antigen.

=======================================

ECG - Sinus rhythm. Baseline artifact. Normal tracing. Compared
to the previous tracing of [**2125-2-12**] there is variation in
precordial lead placement. Early repolarization pattern persists
as recorded previously without diagnostic interim change. The
tracing is normal.

CXR - FINDINGS: In comparison with the study of [**12-18**], the tip
of the NG tube lies within the lower esophagus and should be
advanced at least 12-15 cm. ET tube tip is about 7 cm above the
carina. Lungs remain clear.

CXR - FINDINGS: As compared to the previous radiograph, the
nasogastric tube has been advanced. The tip of the tube now
projects over the proximal parts of the stomach. There is no
evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

Brief Hospital Course:
69M with history of CVA, GI bleed due to duodenal ulcer admitted
with upper GI bleed.

# GI bleed: He was admitted to the medical ICU for further
management.  There he underwent upper endoscopy under
intubation. There was no active source of bleeding identified
although it was hypothesized that bleeding may have been due to
punctate areas in the fundus, gastritis, or unseen [**Doctor First Name 329**] [**Doctor Last Name **]
tear.  Testing for H. pylori serology was positive. He was
extubated post-procedure.  He remained hemodynamically stable
without evidence of active bleeding.  Serial hematocrits were
obtained, which were stable in the high thirties.  He was
started on high dose proton pump inhibitor twice daily.  He was
discharged with prescriptions for a PPI [**Hospital1 **] x 1 week, followed
by a two-week course of a Prevpac, for treatment of his H.
pylori. He was also instructed to call for a GI follow-up
appointment.

# Fever: Prior to being called out of the MICU, the patient was
found to have a temperature of 100.3.  There was no clear source
of infection clinically.  Urine and blood cultures were obtained
and did not reveal significant growth (there was a small amount
of bacteria on the urine cx). Potentially, this fever
represented atelectasis in the setting of his ICU stay. He
remained afebrile throughout the rest of his hospitalization.

# Dementia: He was continued on aricept and citalopram. Mental
status remained at baseline, per the patient's wife.

# OSA: He was continued on home CPAP.

# Neurogenic bladder: Foley in place while he was in the MICU.
Per wife, scheduled voiding at home. Foley was d/c'ed prior to
d/c.

out. IV recussitation was administered. Blood cultures were
sent. He was taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] who performed
an exploratory lap with lysis of adhesions and reduction of
internal volvulus for small bowel obstruction. He was given FFP
for an inr of 2.3 (on coumadin for afib)and coumadin was held.
Of note, he has a pacemaker. Please refer to Dr.[**Name (NI) 670**]
operative note. Per OR note, the fascial incision was opened
down to the pubic symphysis and almost to the xiphoid process.
We took down some internal adhesions to the anterior abdominal
wall. In doing this,a large serosal tear occurred which was
repaired with a series of sutures. A large portion of the small
bowel appeared gangrenous. The bowel was de-torsed. There was
concern for the viability of the bowel and a second laparotomy
was planned. He was temporarily closed. On [**7-1**], he was taken
back to the OR where the bowel appeared viable and he was
closed. Postop, he was sent to the SICU for management. He was
kept NPO with an NG tube in place. CXR demonstrated a left lower
lobe retrocardiac opacity was new. He continued on IV
antibiotics. He was transferred out of the SICU on****

IV Cefepime,Flagyl and Vanco were administered from [**7-1**] thru
[**7-3**]. WBC had been 13.6 on admission. This decreased to 5.5 by
[**7-3**]. Blood cultures were negative and an MRSA screen was also
negative.

TPN was started on postop day 4 ([**7-3**])as he remained NPO for
bowel rest and because he was sleepy. By [**7-7**], he was passing
flatus and stool. The NG was removed. He continued to be
lethargic. Speech and swallow evaluated on [**2173-7-8**] recommending
the following:
PO diet of thin liquids and soft solids.  Select ONLY moist soft
foods. Please cut food into small, manageable pieces. Pills
whole or crushed with puree.  1:1 assistance with POs.  Give POs
only when most awake and alert.  Maintain aspiration
precautions. Q8 oral care. Diet was slowly advanced. TPN
continued. PO intake was fair. KCAL counts were ordered and
started on [**7-14**] to determine if TPN could be weaned off.

Hemodialysis was continued via the LUE AVG. Until, [**7-7**] when his
graft clotted and dialysis could not be performed. He was also
noted to be tachypnic in afib. CXR demonstrated fluid overload.
A temporary right groin line was placed and he was  dialyzed for
3 liters. Afib converted to sinus rhythm. Of note,
cardiac/antihypertensives were held when npo. Hematocrit was
noted to have slowly trended down to 23. One unit of PRBC was
administered and epogen was increased at dialysis.

On [**2173-7-13**], a LUE AVG thrombectomy was performed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]. There was a thrill/bruit and radial pulse. Of note, the
preop cxr demonstrated improvement in left basilar opacity with
minimal bibasilar atelectasis and small right pleural effusion.
The left subclavian line was noted. On [**7-14**], hemodialysis was
performed via the graft with good flows and 2.5 liters were
removed. The temporary right groin dialysis line was removed
without incident.

PT evaluated and recommended rehab. He was screened by [**Hospital 671**]
Rehab in [**Location (un) 86**] and was accepted there.

Most of home meds were held during this hospital course. At time
of discharge, amiodarone and lopressor 12.5 [**Hospital1 **], asa, coumadin
4mg qd, cinacalcet and zantac were resume. Hydralazine and

vessels.

GI BLEEDING STUDY:

INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for 90 minutes were obtained. The patient
was again imaged dynamically for 20 one minute images at 9 hours
after the original injection. Left lateral views of the pelvis
were also obtained. at one hour, 90 minutes and at 9 hours after
injection.

Blood flow images show tortuosity of the aorta, but no bleeding
site.

Dynamic images show no active bleeding site, however left
lateral images show activity in the region of the rectum which
appears to change its configuration on each lateral view,
suggesting a rectal bleeding site



Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with a past medical history significant for DM,
HTN, atrial fibrillation on coumadin, hx tachy-brady s/p
pacemaker, ESRD on HD status post recent exploratory laparotomy
for small bowel obstruction admitted with lower GI bleed.
.
Lower GI Bleed:  The patient had two large bowel movements
consistent with hematochezia at presentation.  Patient had known
diverticular disease; nasogastric lavage was negative in the ED,
and an upper GI bleed was thought to be less likely.  Patient
was receiving warfarin at rehab center prior to presentation;
all anti-coagulation was held after admission.  The patient
initially was managed in the medical ICU, and received a total
of 6 units of packed red blood cells.  His hematocrit trended
from 25.5 to 30.8, which was at his baseline.  Gastroenterology
evaluated the patient.  Given his history of diverticulosis from
a [**2167**] colonoscopy and recent exploratory surgery for a small
bowel obstruction, urgent colonoscopy was deferred, as the
patient was improving with conservative management.  After the
transfusions, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and
was transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**2173-7-26**].  Following
transfer, the patient had two very small episodes of
hematochezia, without hemodynamic compromise.  Anti-coagulation
continued to be held.  The patient remained stable on the floor,
without any recurrence of hematochezia.  The patient will have a
colonoscopy within the next two weeks by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 679**], who is his
gastroenterologist.
.
Diabetes Mellitus - The patient was managed with sliding scale
humalog during his course with good glycemic control.
.
History of atrial fibrillation, status post ablation; history of
tachy-brady syndrome status post pacemaker placement:  Warfarin,
aspirin and beta-blockade was held in the setting of the lower
GI bleed.  Amiodarone was continued.  This regimen was continued
upon discharge to [**Hospital 671**] rehab.  The rehab center will contact
the patient's PCP, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 216**], in one week to decide when
to restart anti-coagulation.
.
Hypertension- Metoprolol was restarted upon discharge to Radius.
.
Dyslipidemia:  Simvastatin was continued during his
hospitalization.
.
End stage renal disease on dialysis every Monday, Wednesday,
Friday:  The patient's hemodialysis schedule was continued
during his hospitalization.  Nephrocaps, renagel, and
darbopoetin were also continued.  The patient will remain on
this schedule after discharge.
.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism: Cinacelcet and Zampler were
continued.
.
Of note, the patient received a brief course of meropenem given
history of drug-resistant urinary tract infections.  This was
stopped after a urine culture was negative.

FEN- The patient was initially kept fasting, and liquids and a
regular diet was gradually re-introduced without complication.
.
Prophylaxis: pneumoboots, ppi
.
Access: A left subclavian central line that had been placed
during prior admission on [**2173-7-16**] was removed on [**2173-7-28**] prior
to discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted after experiencing bloody bowel movements.  In
the Emergency Department, you started receiving blood
transfusions.  You were evaluated by both the surgeons and
gastrointestinal physicians, and it was decided to continue to
treat you with medications and transfusions, and not to do any
procedures.  You first received care in the ICU, where you
slowly started to respond to treatment.  You continued receiving
your regular Monday, Wednesday, and Friday dialysis while in the
hospital.  You continued to improve, and you were transferred
from the ICU to the general medical floor.  It was decided to
wait another 2-4 weeks to do a colonoscopy to look for the
source of your bleeding, as you recently had surgery.  You
continued to do well on the floor, and did not need any more
transfusions.  You were discharged on [**2173-7-28**] to [**Hospital 671**] Rehab

Brief Hospital Course:
78 yo M with a history of HTN, DM2, CKD, prior CVA, Afib s/p
perc chole for cholecystitis, with biliary cultures growing MDR
E.coli. Hospital course complicated by altered mental status
most likely secondary to delirium (although a new CVA cannot be
excluded), admission to SICU because  and brief episode of
hypotension at dialysis in the setting of Afib with RVR. Each of
the problems addressed during this hospitalization are described
in detail below:

Delirium: Throughout the hospital course, the patient was
confused.  On [**2173-9-1**], the patient was noted to have worsening
of mental status and was evaluated by Neurology with a concern
for a possible CVA given INR subtheraputic for procedure.
Non-contrast head CT was performed which showed no acute
intracranial bleed and old PCA infarct.  However, a new CVA
could not be excluded and MRI could not be performed as the
patient has a pacemaker. However, neurological exam remained
stable and no new focal neurological deficits were noted.
Confusion and agitation was believed to be secondary to delirium
of infectious etiology and long hospitalization.  At some points
during hospitalization, the patient became more agitated and
exhibited paranoid ideation.  He ended up pulling out his
percutaneous chole tube (see below).   He was started on
Seroquel 12.5mg daily per psychiatry recs.  EKGs were closely
monitored for QT prolongation.  The patient's agitation and
paranoid ideation have resolved prior to discharge, mental
status somewhat improved.  He no longer required restraints. The
plan is for the patient to continue on Seroquel 12.5 mg QHS.
Statin is continued.  He may be given additional 12.5mg doses of
Seroquel up to a total of 37.5mg daily.

Cholecystitis: Patient was admitted with a diagnosis of acute
Cholecystitis for which he got a percutaneous cholecystostomy
tube.  Biliary cultures grew out multi- drug resitant E. coli,
which was sensitive to Meropenem. The patient was started on
Meropenem, with a plan to complete a two week course (Day 1 =
[**2173-9-1**], last day [**2173-9-14**]).  He had a PICC tube placed in his
right arm for antibiotic delivery. At the time of discharge, the
PICC is in mid-portion of superior vena cava but chest X-ray,
can can be used as a midline for antibiotic delivery.  The
patient pulled out his percutaneous chole tube on [**2173-9-8**] while
his was agitated.  At that point, the patient was evaluated by
surgery. HIDA scan was performed, which showed no gallbladder
filling, but no evidence of bile leak, and RUQ U/S, which did
reveal persistent edema in gallbladder, but insufficient fluid
to replace a drain.  Abdominal exam continued to be benign with
was with some right upper quadrant tenderness, but no guarding
or rebound tenderness.  White blood cell counts remained stable.
 On admission, the patient with mild transaminitis, which
resolved after percutaneous chole placement.  The patient
remained stable with no signs concerning for peristent
cholecystitis or sepsis.  The patient will follow-up with his
surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for elective cholecystectomy 2 weeks after
discharge.

Afib with RVR: s/p ablation in the past. The patient had an
episode of atrial fibrillation with RVR with hypotension during
hemodialysis session early during admission. The patient was
evaluated by EP service and Echocardiogram was performed, which
revealed no new wall motion abnormalities.  Cardiac biomarkers
were negative for a myocardial infarction, Troponins were stably
elevated due to the patient's ESRD. The patient's heart rates
and blood pressures remained stable during the rest of the
admission. We continued amiodarone 100mg po daily during this
admission.  We continued rate control with Metoprolol 12.5mg po
bid with holding parameters for hypotension and bradycardia.
Later in hospitalization course, EKG showed normal sinus rhythm,
with LVH and LAD. ST segment changes likely due to
repolarization abnormality. The patient was monitored on
Telemetry and remained chest pain free throughout this
admission.  Given history of atrial fibrillation with embolic
strokes, the patient was re-started on anticoagulation with
Coumadin after percutaneous cholecystostomy with the goal INR of
[**1-19**].  At the time of discharge, Coumadin was held for 2 days for
supratherapeutic INR.  On the day of discharge, INR is 2.6 and
the patient should be restarted on 3mg of Coumadin nightly.  The
patient also was evaluated by carotid ultrasound, which revealed
bilateral carotid stenosis of <40%.

Diabetes mellitus type 2:  BG currently remained under control
during this admission.  We monitored blood glucose QID and
continued the patient on sliding scale.

Hypertension: Per neurology recommendations, systolic blood
pressure goal was 150-160 to assure sufficient brain perfusion
as the stroke could not be ruled out.  There was some difficulty
accurately measuring BP accurately because of AV fistula on left
arm, PICC in right arm, thighs and calves have not yielded
consistent BPs.
We continued Metoprolol 12.5 [**Hospital1 **].

ESRD on dialysis: The patient is on dialysis on Mondays,
Wednesdays and Fridays, last HD in the morning on Friday,
[**2173-9-10**].  He has tolerated HD without complications.

Nutrition:   The patient failed speech and swallow while with
Altered Mental Status early during hospitalization course.
Dubhoff tube was placed (but was not post-pyloric).  As the
mental status improved, the patient passed speech and swallow,
and was upgraded to ground solids, thin liquids prior to
discharge.  Nutrition recommended supplementation with Ensure.
At the time of discharge, the patient's calorie counts have
remained low (300's per day), but the patient has been able to
tolerate PO intake and has complained about the taste of the
food.  We recommend no dietary restriction to facilitate PO
intake.  Given low calorie counts, the patient is being
discharged with a Dobhoff tube in place as he may need
resumption of his tube feeds if he does not take sufficient PO
intake. He will need to be monitored closely by calorie counts.


Anemia: The patient with normocytic anemia, with worsening
during this admission.  The presentation is most consistent with
anemia of chronic disease.  Hematocrit remained stable at at the
time of discharge.  The patient was Guaiac negative prior to
discharge.

Wound care: The patient has a Stage II sacral decubitous ulcer
on his buttocks.  Mepilex dressing was applied and should
continue to be applied upon discharge.
Recommendation is to cleanse with commercial wound cleanser and
change dressing every three days or as needed.

ACCESS: PICC on (placement date [**9-2**]).  Per CXR on [**2173-9-9**], tip
in mid-portion of SVC, and may be used for antibiotic delivery.

Of note, the patient had a rectal swab that was positive for VRE
during this admission.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary: Cholecystitis, Delirium, Atrial Fibrillation

Secondary: Diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
prior stroke.


Discharge Condition:
Vitals stable, oxygen saturation over 95% on room air, improved
mental status


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital because you developed
abdominal pain.  You were found to have inflammation of your
gallbladder known as cholecystitis.  A drainage tube was placed
surgically into your gallbladder to drain the infected biliary
fluid.  You biliary fluid was infected with a bacterium that is
resistant to many types of antibiotics.  You were started on a
strong antibiotic called Meropenem that is given by IV for your
gallbladder infection.  You will need to take this antibiotic
for a total of 2 weeks.  You also had an episode of low blood
pressure during dialysis due to your atrial fibrillation with an
increased heart rate.  This resolved and has not recurred.

During your hospitalization, you became confused and agitated,
likely because of your infection.  This condition is known as
Delirium.  You were seen by Neurology to evaluate whether you
had suffered a new stroke.  At this point, it is not certain
whether or not you had a new stroke.  As you were agitated and
pulled out your drainage tube, you had to be restrained.  You
were also seen by Psychiatry doctors and started on Seroquel for
your agitation. At the time of discharge, you are less agitated
but still occasionally confused.  It is possible for your
confusion to last a few weeks even after your infection has been
treated.

At the time of discharge, your mental status is improving and
you are less confused.  You pain is under control, and you are
able to tolerate a pureed diet.

We made several changes to your medications:

1. You will need to complete a course of Meropenem mg every 12
hours.  Your last day of antibiotic treatment will be [**2173-9-14**].

2. You have been started on Seroquel, 12 mg at night for your
delirium.  This medication may be stopped at some point in the
future depending on your mental status.  You should be
reevaluated by your physician in the next week to determine
whether this should be continued.

3. Please take your other medications as directed.

You have a follow-up appointment with your surgeon Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(see below).

Should you develop fevers, worsening abdominal pain, nausea,
vomiting, worsening confusion or increased confusion, or any
other concerning symptoms, please call your Primary Care Doctor
or return to the Emergency Department.

CXR:
The heart size is normal. The aorta is tortuous and there is
calcification within the aortic knob. Ill-defined densities
noted within the right lung base. Questinable nodular densities
are scattered through out both lungs. The left retrocardiac
density corresponds to the hiatal hernia and appears unchanged
compared to the prior study. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
is detected. The soft tissue and osseous structures are
unremarkable.

IMPRESSION:
Right basilar infiltrate is suggestive of peumonia.
Equivocal densities scattered through out both lungs need
further evaluation by nonurgent chest CT.

CT Abd/Pelvis:
 Innumerable nodules measuring up to 13 mm in diameter are seen
in the imaged portion of the lung bases. The imaged portion of
the heart and pericardium appear unremarkable. Several enlarged
lymph nodes, some with hypodense centers, are seen in the
pericardial fat measuring up to 15 mm in diameter. Several
peripherally located heterogeneously hypodense lesions are seen
about the right and left lobes of the liver in subserosal
location consistent with metastases. The largest of these, in
the right lobe (2:14), measures 2.6 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional nodular and irregular foci involve the peripheral
aspects of segments V, VI, IVb and [**Doctor First Name 690**].

At the gastric fundus, a heterogeneous mass measures 3.4 x 2.6
cm and protrudes into the lumen (2:18).

Numerous enlarged lymph nodes and mesenteric masses are seen
throughout the entire abdomen. Two confluent omental masses
anteriorly (2:44) measure up to 6.1 cm in diameter. Numerous
additional mesenteric lymph nodes as well as retroperitoneal
nodes along the celiac axis and in aortocaval and paraaortic
location have hypodense centers consistent with central
necrosis. These are located in the omentum anteriorly (2:27), in
the lesser sac (2:27), adjacent to the spleen and along the left
lateral peritoneum (2:27, 21), and throughout the mesenteric
root (2:45). The pancreatic duct is nondilated and no definite
pancreatic masses are identified. The adrenal glands are mildly
nodular appearing although no definite masses are identified.
Bilateral hypodense renal lesions are too small to characterize.
There is no hydronephrosis. The aorta is normal in caliber with
mural calcification consistent with atheromatous disease. A
serosal mass involving the descending colon (2:60) measures 3.5
x 3.3 cm. The colon is displaced in multiple other locations by
multiple omental and serosal masses. There is no evidence of
bowel obstruction.

CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: A heterogeneous centrally
hypodense mass spans the width of the lower abdomen and pelvis,
tethering the terminal ileum and cecum as well as the sigmoid
colon, and is contiguous with the uterus and adnexa. Overall,
this mass measures up to 14 cm in greatest transaxial dimension.
The sigmoid colon is extensively encased. The bladder contains
gas, and the dome of the bladder just touches the confluent
pelvic mass. Additional nodular implants are seen in the
rectovaginal cul-de-sac (2:78).

BONE WINDOWS: No definite lesions worrisome for osseous
metastatic disease are identified. There is lumbar scoliosis and
degenerative change.

IMPRESSION:

1. Innumerable omental and peritoneal masses throughout the
abdomen and pelvis, with the largest confluent mass in the deep
pelvis.

2. 3.4 x 2.6 cm gastric fundal mass.

3. Pulmonary metastases.

4. Serosal hepatic metastases.

5. Encasement of the uterus and sigmoid colon, and questionable
involvement of the bladder, by the conglomerate pelvic mass. No
evidence of bowel obstruction.

6. Air within the bladder. Please correlate with any possible
history of recent Foley catheterization.

Possible etiologies for the extensive metastatic disease could
include gastric cancer with metastases, versus other
gastrointestinal primary with metastases, or ovarian cancer.
Clinical correlation is recommended.

COLON BIOPSIES:
Proximal sigmoid colon mass, biopsy:

Colonic mucosa with chronic active inflammation.
No neoplasm seen.
Multiple levels have been examined.
Note: Possible causes include compression from an external
lesion or an intrinsic chronic colitis.

EGD:
Normal mucosa within the esophagus, stomach and duoenum. No sign
of gastric mass.

Colonoscopy:
Partially obstructing mass noted in the proximal sigmoid colon
(40cm) covered by normal appearing mucosa. Unable to pass scope
further.


Brief Hospital Course:
GI bleed: The patient intitially presented with a GI bleed.
Based on the presentation of more maroon stool than melena, it
was felt to be consitent with a lower GI bleed. Her INR was
significantly elevated at presentation, which was felt to be
contributing significantly to her bleeding. Her INR was reversed
with 2 units of FFP and 10mg of Vitamin K. She was initially
monitored in the ICU but remained hemodynamically stable and
required no blood transfusions with a stable hematocrit after
INR reversal. She was transferred to the floor and underwent a
colonoscopy after an uneventful prep. The colonoscopy found a
partially obstructing mass in the proximal sigmoid colon with
normal appearing mucosa. It was unclear if this was an
instrinsic vs. an extrinsic colonic mass pressing in so she
underwent a CT of her abd/pelvis. This found what is likely
diffuse metastatic disease, further discussed below. Her
coumadin has been stopped secondary to her increased bleeding
risk with her abdominal malignancy and for improved quality of
life. Her hematocrit remained stable througout her admission
with no further bleeding

Abdominal malignancy: As noted above, the patient was found to
have what appears to be diffuse metastatic disease throughout
her abdomen and lower lungs. The spread was consistent with a
gastric primary. Initial biopsies from the colonoscopy returned
as normal tissue, not surprising given the mass was only
extrinsically compressing the colon. An EGD was performed which
was entirely normal, indicating that the gastric mass seen on CT
was likely extraluminal. In discussion with the patient, she did
not desire any further work up including any other biopsies. She
does not desire any surgery or chemotherapy. A palliative care
consult was called and discussed hopsice options with the
patient. Fortunately, the patient was asymptomatic in regards to
her cancer. She was without pain, N/V, able to eat normally and
have normal bowel movement.  Home hospice was set up and she was
discharged with close follow up with her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was also set
up with an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in GI oncology to allow her
to ask further questions or discuss further options. She was
discharged with a prescription for stool softeners.

Pneumonia/UTI: The patient initially had a leukocytosis and a
positive U/A for a UTI. She also have a RLL infiltrate seen on
CXR. These were both treated with IV ceftriaxone and
transitioned to PO cefpodoxime, to finish a brief course at
home.

HTN: Initially her HTN meds were held in the setting of the GI
bleed. After she stabilized, they were restarted at lower doses
with good effect. She will be discharged on these lower doses
and follow up with her PCP.

A.fib: The patient remain rate controlled on her beta-blocker.
Her coumadin was stopped as above. She was continued on her low
dose aspirin.

Hypothyroidism: Continued on her home dose of Synthroid with
good effect.

Facility:
Hospice of the [**Hospital3 **]

Discharge Diagnosis:
Likely metastatic abdominal cancer, primary unknown
Lower gastrointestinal bleed
HTN
Atrial fibrillation
Coronary Artery Disease


Discharge Condition:
All vital signs stable, pain free, tolerating POs.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted with a GI bleed, likely from your lower
abdominal tract. This was likely caused by your elevated
coumadin level. During the work up for this, it was discovered
that you likely have metastatic cancer throughout your abdomen,
including pushing on your lower colon. As we discussed with you
and your family, we will not pursue any aggressive diagnosis,
including further biopsies. We will also not pursue chemotherapy
or surgery at this time. You will follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
we will set up a follow up appointment with one of our abdominal
cancer doctors to discuss [**Name5 (PTitle) 691**] further questions you may have.

We have stopped your coumadin as the risk from bleeding is
greater due to your cancer than the risk of stroke. We have also
decreased your blood pressure medications slightly as you did
not require as much while you were in hospital.

You were also diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia and a
urinary tract infection while here. You were initially treated
with an IV antibiotic to treat both. This was changed to an oral
antibiotic that you will finish taking at home.

In discussion with you and your family, we have arranged for you
to go home with hospice assistance for further care.

Please call your doctor or the hospice nurses if you experience
abdominal pain, bleeding, nausea/vomitting, constipation,
difficulty urinating or any other symptoms that concern you.

Followup Instructions:
Please call Dr.[**Name (NI) 692**] office at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 693**] to schedule a
follow up appointment in the next 2-4 weeks.

You have an appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (abdominal cancer doctor)
on [**5-2**] at 2pm. Please call ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 694**] to reschedule.

History of Present Illness:
55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her
husband.

The patient has a history of depression which her husband, [**Name (NI) **],
reports has been exacerbated lately by several stressful
situations including her chronic back pain, finances, etc.  She
was last seen to be interactive and appropriate at 06:00am this
morning by her husband.  [**Name (NI) **] son saw her at 11am, but thought
the patient was asleep and did not attempt to wake her.  She was
subsequently found down on the floor by her husband at 3pm, 9
hours after last being seen, who describes her as being in a
fetal position with her eyes rolled to the back of her head and
her mouth wide open.  Her husband began to lift the patient off
the floor and she bit him on the shoulder and did not appear to
recognize him.  She was take to [**Hospital6 33**] where she
was was found to be responsive to verbal stimuli but unable to
interact appropriately.  She was intubated.  Coffee grounds
returned from her OGT and she was hypotensive in the 80's/40's.
FS was 22 and received glucose, T was 94.6, and she was placed
on a bear hugger.  pH was 6.8, lacate 25, creatine 3.2, bicarb
4.  She was received 2 amps bicarb, 1 amp D50, and blood
cultures were drawn from her central line.  She was started on
bicarb drip, levophed gtt for SBP 80's.  She not making urine
after 6L IVF.  She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further
management.  R IJ was placed at the OSH and 2 peripheral IVs.
.
Per the husband's report, the patient does have a history of
surreptitious alcohol ingestion on occasion but he has not
noticed or detected any alcohol use recently.  He denies the
likelihood of illicit drug use or prescription drug overdose,
stating the only medication she has access to is Tramadol, which
she had not been taking.  He denies recent vocalizations by the
patient regarding suicidal ideation.
.
In the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, initial VS:  123   113/29   27   100%
The patient was noted to have 150cc dark coffee ground output
from her OGT, but stool was guiac negative.  Hepatology was
consulted, and the patient was started on an Octreotide gtt and
Pantoprazole gtt, and aggressive flushing of the OGT was
recommended.  She was ordered to be transfused 1 unit PRBC.  She
was empirically treated with Vanc/Levo/Flagyl and CT torso was
obtained, which showed no evidence of infection or acute bleed.
She received 8L IVF in the ED, and was increased on Levophed
0.4mcg/kg/hr.  Renal was consulted as the patient had a poor UOP
and was acidotic, and CVVH vs hemodialysis was discussed.  The
patient was given Calcium gluconate 2gm, Bicarb gtt @150cc/hr,
and was prepared for possible CVVH tomorrow.  Transfer VS were:
112/47, HR 117, 99% 60% PEEP 5, TV 450
.
On arrival to the MICU, the patient was intubated and opening
her eyes to verbal stimuli but not following commands.  Her
husband was available to give a brief history, which is detailed
above.

Brief Hospital Course:
55yoF with alcoholic cirrhosis s/p TIPS [**1-/2118**] found down by her
husband and admitted to MICU with GIB and resp failure.
Improved in the MICU and was extubated [**6-14**].  On the floor, Ms.
[**Known lastname 696**] was noted to have AMS likely [**1-18**] Korsakoff's amnesia.

1. Abdominal wall hematoma: pt began to complain of pain at site
of what was originally though to be a ventral hernia in LLQ.
the abd protrusion was palpated and had crepitus and could be
reduced, so no action was taken and mass was thought to be a
hernia at that time.  Pt was supposed to go for colonoscopy but
K+ was low, so it was delayed until [**2119-7-4**].  pt felt diarrhea
had improved this day.  Creatinine was elevated to 2.1 and this
thought to be [**1-18**] poor renal perfusion.  pt started on albumin
100mg.  Renal u/s was negative for obstruction. Her hct was 17.5
at midnight and pt received 2 units PRBC, repeat hct was 24.8.
Pt's abdominal protrusion had approx doubled in size and was
very tender.  Pt went to GI suite for colonoscopy, which did not
show a source of bleeding.  After colonoscopy, abdominal
protrusion was over twice as large as in the AM and continued to
progress rapidly throughout day.  It developed a bluish
appearance - surgery was consulted and pt sent for non con CT
which showed a hematoma.  Repeat Hct after CT was 21.0, so pt
given another unit of PRBC and also transfused 1 unit FFP, and
100mg cryoprecipitate.  Cr was down to 2.0 after albumin but
jumped again in the PM to 2.3, likely [**1-18**] ongoing blood loss.

2. post-operative course: Patient was taken for evacuation of
hematoma on [**2119-7-5**] and [**7-6**] with intraop 2L paracentesis.
Intraop: 1u prbc, 1u FFP, albumin. Patient extubated and
responsive postop. Patient transfused 2u PRBC's for Hct 25 in
setting of active bleeding. Additional 7u PRBC next 2 nights. JP
putting out sanguineous fluid, Hct decreasing. Transfused 2u
PRBC, 2 FFP, 1 cryo. Direct pressure applied to LLQ. JP Hct
sent. Ceftriaxone started for SBP per Hepatology recs.  on [**7-7**] U PRBC given, started 1/2cc per cc replacement of JP output.
UOP adequate. Pain control adequate. on [**7-8**], 2u FFP given for
INR 1.7. High JP output continued, so NS repletion increased to
cc per cc. Pt later became acutely dyspneic with desaturation to
high 70s. CXR was consistent with flash pulmonary edema. IVF
were discontinued, and pt responded well to BiPAP and 40 IV
Lasix. Pt later weaned to nasal cannula. IVF repletion of JP
output resumed at 1/2cc per cc ratio. Remained persistently
tachycardic throughout. Increasing PVCs improved with K
repletion. Regular diet started. Overnight, she had a burst of
tachycardia to the 170s, EKG unchanged and troponin was
negative. She was transferred from the ICU to the floor on [**7-10**].
She complained of shortness of breath during the day when she
was sitting but also had a component of anxiety. She ambulated,
was tolerating a regular diet, and making good urine. She
continued on her ceftriaxone. On [**7-12**], she underwent a
diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis, 3L was taken off and
sent for studies, which showed clearance of her SBP. She was
switched to ciprofloxacin. She ambulated with physical therapy.
Tolerating regular diet.

3. Mental status: On transfer to the floor from MICU, the
patient was noted to be confused with AMS.  Differential was
initially anoxic brain injury vs. hepatic encephalopathy vs.
delerium vs. withdrawal.  Psych and neuro were consulted.
Benzos were weaned.  Lactulose was provided and an MRI brain
revealed no evidence of anoxic brain injury.  Given the
prominence of the patient's confabulations and the absence of
memory loss, it was suspected by neurology that the patient was
suffering from Korsakoff's amnesia.  The patient's family was
informed of this diagnosis.

4. GIB: Patient with coffee grounds out of NG tube on admission
and noted to have bright red blood coming from NG tube during
first several days of admission. She was started on Octreotide
and Pantoprazole gtt's. She was given 1u plts, 3u FFP, 3u
PRBC's, 10 mg IV Vitamin K through admission. Liver was
consulted, and felt since imaging showed patent TIPS that UGIB
from portal HTN was unlikely. Pt was eventually scoped which
showed 2cm non-bleeding ulcer with clot overlying and she was
given an NG tube holiday to prevent irritation and allow
healing. Also showed mild portal gastropathy. Hct was stable by
call out of MICU. On the floor, the patient was HD stable.  On
[**6-23**], it was noted that the patient was tachycardic to the 140s.
HCT fell from 34.4 to 28.7 and BRBPR was noted. The patient had
undergone a sigmoidoscopy to evaluate for ?ischemic colitis the
day prior without a bleeding source noted.  On the AM of [**6-23**] she
underwent an endoscopy also without evidence of a bleeding
source.  The patient was transfused with appropriate HCT
response and remained stable without BRBPR afterward.  Source of
bleeding was likely hemorrhoidal.  From [**6-27**] - [**6-29**] she was
transfused 4u pRBCs total.

5. Hypotension: Fluid resuscitated with crystalloid and colloid.
Started on Levophed gtt. Arterial line placed. She was given
broad spectrum ABx (Vanc/Zosyn) and the only culture which grew
out was MSSA in her sputum. Echo was normal. Of note, after
weaned from pressors and stabilized, necessitated diuresis for
volume overload/pulmonary edema.

6. Renal failure: Felt to be ATN due to hypotension vs HRS vs
mild rhabdomyolysis given mildly elevated CK's. She was
initially on a HCO3 gtt, and was fluid resuscitated.
Electrolytes were very abnormal (K, Phos, and Ca) and were
repleted aggressively until they normalized. She never needed
dialysis and her renal function improved.

7. Alcoholic Cirrhosis s/p TIPS:  Patient with US in the ED
showing patent TIPS. She received IV thiamine and IV Folate. She
was started on Lactulose and Rifaxamin after extubation; and
liver recommended starting Pentoxyfyline x30 days when pt able.
Repeat U/S on [**2119-7-15**] again showed patent TIPS

8. AFib: She had an episode of AFib with RVR that flipped back
to NSR with IV Metoprolol. No further issues.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 711**] is an 84 M with h/o MI, CABG, CHF presents with 4
days of worsening mildly productive cough. On the night before
admission, his cough worsened and he felt warm with a fever to
101. He tried his wife's albuterol which did not help. He denies
SOB, sore throat, congestion, chest pain, lightheadedness,
headache, dysuria/frequency, abdominal pain,
diarrhea/constipation. Over the past month, he has reduced his
salt intake and lost 25 lbs after being in congestive heart

had shingles over his right eye.
.
In the ED, initial VS were: 100 94 117/46 18 95/ 2LNC. Exam
bilateral rales, R>L crackles. ED staff initially felt he had a
possible LLL opacity and gave him azithro 500mg and ceftriaxone
1gm, but his final read felt there was no focal infiltrate, just
some mild vascular engorgement. His SBP was in the 120s for the
first couple of hours, and he was initially signed out to the
general medical floor, but prior to transfer, his SBP dipped to
the 80s so he was given 1 L NS plus another 500cc. His SBP
remained in the 85-95 range with sats in the mid 90s on 2-3L.
His BNP is 5805, at his baseline. His lactate was 2.9 and his Cr
3.0 (baseline around 2.5-2.8). EKG afib 78, old inf Qs,
unchanged. A UA was negative. He has 2 PIVs. He will get the
rest of his second liter on transport to the MICU.
.
On the floor, he appears well and endorses the above HPI, though
his SBP is in the 80s. He has 150cc of urine in the foley that
was placed in the ED. He is mentating well and satting in the
mid 90s on 2L.

voltage. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2108-4-26**] no
diagnostic interim change.
.
Imaging:
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-9**]: Heart is enlarged. The aorta is
calcified and tortuous. Sternotomy wires and mediastinal clips
are compatible with history of CABG. There is no evidence of
pneumonia. Reticular opacities at the lung bases likely
represent chronic lung disease, grossly unchanged since prior
exam. Hyperinflated lungs are compatible with known COPD. Study
is limited as both costophrenic angles are not included in the
image. IMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with no pulmonary edema or
pneumonia.
.
CXR PA and lateral [**2108-5-16**]: Since most recent prior radiograph,
there has been interval improvement of interstitial pulmonary
edema to baseline subtle mild interstitial prominence. No focal
parenchymal consolidation concerning for pneumonia. Interval
development of small bilateral pleural effusions is noted. There
is no pneumothorax. Cardiomediastinal and hilar contours are
stable demonstrating mild cardiomegaly and post-CABG and
sternotomy changes. IMPRESSION: Interval improvement of
interstitial pulmonary edema. Interval development of small
bilateral pleural effusions. Otherwise, no significant change.

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan: Mr. [**Known lastname 711**] is an 84 yo male with history
of vascular disease, CAD, dCHF, afib who presents with cough,
fever, and low blood pressure without clear radiographic
evidence of pneumonia.
.
#. Cough/fever/shortness of breath: The patient presented with
cough and fever, suspicious for community-acquired pneumonia,
although this diagnosis was never definitely established. His
CXR showed a possible LLL infiltrate (not thought to be present
in the final read) and he was started on ceftriaxone and
azithromycin. His sputum culture did not grow bacteria, but it
was positive for parainfluenza virus type 3. Antibiotics were
continued because of hypotension (requiring MICU
admission),suggesting possible bacterial superinfection. The
patient was treated with azithromycin, completing a 5-day
course, and ceftriaxone, with a plan to treat for 14 days. Prior
to discharge, ceftriaxone was changed to cefpodixime. The
patient will complete treatment with cefpodoxime on [**2108-5-22**].
  The patient never required intubation, but he developed
significant reactive airway disease requiring aggressive
nebulizers and chest physical therapy. His recovery was
complicated by pulmonary edema as explained below. His O2
saturations were in the low 90s for several days on 4-5L O2 by
NC. These slowly improved and by day five he was transferred to
medical floor.
  On the medical floor, the patient was hemodynamically stable.
His oxygenation improved to the low 90s on room air at rest, but
he desaturated to 86% on room air with ambulation. The patient
was persistently wheezy on pulmonary exam. He was discharged on
home oxygen, bronchodilators, and inhaled fluticasone.
.
#. Hypotension: Multiple etiologies likely contributed to the
patient's hypotension, including infection, hypovolemia, and
atrial fibrillation. The patient received 6 liters of IV fluids
during the first day of his admission. With this treatment, his
blood pressure improved. The patient's home antihypertensives
were initially held, but amlodipine, furosemide, and enalapril
were restarted prior to discharge. The patient tolerated these
medications well. Imdur and spironolactone were never restarted,
and consideration should be given to restarting these
medications in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Acute on chronic diastolic congestive heart failure: BNP of
5805 is at his baseline. The patient initially appeared
hypovolemic, but after aggressive fluid resuscitation for
hypotension, he became volume overloaded. The patient was
initially treated with IV Lasix before being transitioned back
to his home regimen of Lasix 40 mg daily. The patient was still
mildly hypervolemic at the time of discharge.
.
#. Coronary artery disease: EKG and troponin were unchanged from
baseline. Continued aspirin. Held Imdur in the setting of
hypotension. Consideration should be given to restarting this
medication in the outpatient setting.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation, on Coumadin: The patient remained in
atrial fibrillation. Anticoagulation with Coumadin was
continued. The patient's INR was 1.8 at the time of discharge.
The patient was discharged on his preadmission regimen of
Coumadin 3 mg on Wednesday and Friday and 2 mg on all other
days. The patient's next INR check will be on Monday, [**2108-5-21**].
  The patient has a follow-up appointment with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who is
reportedly planning for pacemaker implantation.
.
#. Wide-complex tachycardia: The patient had a single 15-beat
run of a wide complex tachycardia (non-sustained ventricular
tachycardia versus Afib/aberrency) at a rate of 160. He was
asymptomatic during this episode and had no other tachycardia
during his admission.
.
#. Chronic hypertension: The patient's home blood pressure
medications were inially held due to hypotension. Amlodipine,
enalapril, and furosemide were restarted prior to discharge but
Imdur and spironolactone will need to be restarted in the
outpatient setting.
.
#. Acute on chronic renal insufficiency: The patient creatinine
was 3.0 on admission. This was thought to be due to hypovolemia.
At the time of discharge, the patient's creatinine had decreased
to 1.9, which actually below his recent baseline of 2.4 to 2.7.
The patient will need to have his renal function and
electrolytes checked on [**2108-5-21**]. The patient has a follow-up
appointment in nephrology.

Discharge Instructions:
You came to the hospital with fever and cough. You were
diagnosed with pneumonia, and a viral called parainfluenza was
found in your sputum. You were admitted to the intensive care
unit due to low blood pressure and difficulty breathing. You
were treated with antibiotics and oxygen, with improvement in
your breathing.
.
Initially, your Lasix and several other blood pressure
medications were held, and you were given IV fluids due to low
blood pressure. As your blood pressure improved, your Lasix,
amlodipine, and enalapril were restarted. Spironolactone and
Imdur were not started prior to discharge, but you should talk
to your primary care doctor about when these medications can be
restarted.
.
At the time of discharge, you still required some supplemental
oxygen, so arrangements were made for you to use oxygen at home.
You should use your home oxygen at a rate of 2 liters per
minute. Use oxygen at night, when walking, when you have
coughing spells, and whenever you are feeling short of breath. A
visiting nurse will help monitor your oxygen level and determine
how long you will need to continue to use oxygen.
.
There have been some changes to your medications:
START cefpodoxime. Continue this until [**2108-5-22**]
START combivent inhaler
START fluticasone inhaler
START gabapentin for shingles pain
STOP Imdur (isosorbide mononitrate). Talk to your primary care
doctor about when to restart this.
STOP spironolactone. Talk to your primary care doctor about when
to restart this.
.
Weigh yourself every day. Call your doctor if your weight
increases or decreases by more than 3 pounds. Adhere to a
low-sodium diet.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  64-year-old woman with history
of right parietal occipital hemorrhage in [**10/2156**] with an
admission to the Neurology service.  She presented with
headaches and unsteadiness the last two weeks.  Headaches are
unclear duration.  Very forgetful since [**54**]/[**2156**].  She has
been slowing down as per her family.  Being forgetful,
positive chills, no fevers, positive nausea, no vomiting,
positive diarrhea over last two to three days, cough positive
last three days.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension.
2.  Anxiety.
3.  Hepatitis C.
4.  Right parietal-occipital hemorrhage in 09/[**2156**].
5.  Normal stress test in 11/[**2156**].

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Keppra.
2.  Metoprolol.
3.  Epogen.

ALLERGIES:
1.  Penicillin.
2.  Codeine.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Lives alone; completed eighth-grade
education.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature maximum 97.8, 134/65, 80,
16, 98% on room air.  Generally sleepy; in no acute distress.
Mucous membranes moist.  Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Regular rate and rhythm;
no murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Skin:  No obvious
lesions.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, no masses.  Extremities:
Without edema; moving all extremities.  Neuro:  Arousable to
voice but falls back asleep.  Speech is sparse.  Left visual
space neglect.  Left - lot of motor
impersistence; does not consistently follow commands.
Cranial nerve, fundi, tongue midline.  Motor:  Moves all
extremities well.  Biceps and triceps [**5-9**], IP at best [**5-9**],
bilateral gastrocnemius [**6-8**] bilaterally, deep tendon reflexes
3, toes equivocal.

LABORATORY DATA:  Patient's white count on admission was 8.1,
hematocrit 39, platelets 248, sodium 140, potassium 4.0, 101
chloride, 30 CO2, BUN 16, creatinine 0.4, glucose 137.

IMAGING:  CT of the head:  Right parietal temporal mass;
right to left midline shift; compression of right lateral
ventricle; right lateral ventricle dilated.

MR of the head was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  64 year old, likely primary brain tumor,
now with some headache, visual spatial defects,quick neurologic
deterioration
non-attentiveness admitted to Neurosurgery on [**2157-3-21**].
Steroids and tilt biopsy.  Keppra was continued NPO at
midnight.

The patient continued to deteriorate and remained
significantly more difficult to arouse.  At this point, after
further examining the patient, MRI was obtained which again
further delineated the primary brain tumor.  It would be most
appropriate to perform the
excision of the mass.

Patient was taken urgently to the Operating Room early the
next morning for craniotomy and the mass was removed from the
temporal parietal area.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well. Please see operative dictation.  Continued to improve.

Patient was seen on [**2157-3-23**] by Neuro-Oncology and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**]
and was given instructions to follow up as per prognosis with
patient.

On [**2157-3-24**] dressing was removed.  Patient was
hemodynamically stable.  Diet was increased.  Patient was
seen by Endocrine on [**2157-3-24**], as well, who recommended
repeat thyroid function tests in two weeks to check for
residual endocrine abnormality but no other recommendations
prior to that.

It was decided that patient met criteria and needed to be
seen acutely in rehab.  Endocrine came back and re-evaluated
and maintained again in hypopituitary access, said there was
no evidence of hypothalamic versus pituitary abnormality.

On [**2157-3-25**] patient remained neurologically stable.  Rehab
planning was begun.  Psychiatry evaluated patient.  Their
impression was dementia due to organic process glioblastoma.
Psychiatry recommended Haldol 0.5 mg p.o. b.i.d. standing and
0.5 mg p.o. intravenously b.i.d. p.r.n. agitation and
avoiding benzodiazepines and anticholinergics.

Patient, on [**2157-3-26**], was offered sitters and, for greater
than 24 hours, it was decided that patient, on [**2157-3-27**],
would be able to be discharged to [**Hospital1 **] when bed became
available.  Patient needed to be screened, and insurance
issues prevented her to be discharged on [**2157-3-27**].
However, this was planned for [**2157-3-28**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable status post removal of
glioblastoma.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 724**] regarding
glioblastoma and long-term prognosis in two weeks' time.
2.  Follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] in two weeks' time.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:  Brain tumor.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Change in mental status.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSES:
1.  Endocrine abnormality.
2.  Dementia.

Date of Birth:   [**2093-2-22**]       Sex:  F

Service:  NEUROSURGERY

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 64-year-old
woman with a history of right parietal occipital hemorrhage
in [**2156-10-4**].  She was admitted at that time to the
Neurology Service.

She presented with headaches and unsteadiness for the last
two weeks.  Headaches were of unclear duration, as she has
become very forgetful since [**2156-2-4**].

She has been getting lost in the grocery store, has had no
fever, positive nausea, no vomiting, positive diarrhea for
the last 2-3 days.  She has had positive chest pain on and
off, but none over the last two days prior to admission.  No
cough over the last two days prior to admission.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  Temperature 97.8??????, blood
pressure 134/65, heart rate 80, respirations 16, oxygen
saturation 98% on room air.  General:  She was sleepy but in
no acute distress.  HEENT:  Pupils equal, round and reactive
to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Nonicteric.  Lungs:
Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular rhythm.  No
murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Abdomen:  Soft, nontender,
nondistended.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin:  No obvious lesions.  Neurological:  She was arousable
to voice but then fell back to sleep.  Speech:  Sparse.
Repetition intact.  She had a left visual space neglect.  She
was impersistent with motor exam testing.  She did not
consistently follow commands.  Her pupils were 4 down to 3 mm
bilaterally.  Her face was symmetric.  Tongue midline.  She
moved all extremities well.  Triceps and biceps were 4+ out
of 5 bilaterally.  IP at least 3 out of 5 bilaterally.
Gastrocs 5 out of 5.  Deep tendon reflexes 3+ in the upper
extremities, 3 at the patella, and 2 at the Achilles.  Toes
were equivocal.

IMAGING:  The patient had a head CT that showed right
parietal temporal mass with right-to-left midline shift and
depression of the right lateral ventricle with left lateral
ventricle slightly dilated.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the
Neurosurgery Service.  She received an MRI.  The patient's
mental status deteriorated.  She became unresponsive with a
blown right pupil.  The patient was taken to the Operating
Room emergently for craniotomy for excision and biopsy of the
tumor.

The patient underwent a right parietal temporal craniotomy
for excision of tumor without intraoperative complications.
Postoperatively the patient was monitored in the Recovery
Room over night.  Her vital signs were stable.  She awakened
easily to voice, saying her name.  Pupils were 6 down to 5 mm
bilaterally to ambient light.  She withdrew briskly in her
upper and lower extremities.

On postoperative day #1, she was awake and alert.  Pupils
were 5 down to 4 mm.  She had a left neglect visually.
Strength was symmetric.  Finger flexors and IPs bilaterally.
She was improved and was much more awake and alert.

The patient was seen by Neuro-oncology who recommended
Radiation/Oncology and possible chemotherapy.  She was
transferred to the regular floor on postoperative day #1.
She was out of bed and ambulating.  She was assessed by
Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and found to
require a short rehabilitation stay prior to discharge to
home.

She was also seen by Endocrine due to the mass near her
hyperthalamus.  TSH was slightly decreased with a normal T4.
Endocrine recommended follow-up on PFTs in two weeks.

The patient was therefore prepared for rehabilitation and
discharged to rehabilitation on [**2157-3-30**], with
follow-up in the Brain [**Hospital 341**] Clinic on Monday for staple
removal.

Chief Complaint:
Hypertensive urgency

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

History of Present Illness:
This is a 59 yo F with a history of DM2 and HTN who presents
with L greater than R flank pain, associated with nausea and
visual blurring. Patient has had L sided flank pain since the
night prior to admission. This was associated with blurry vision
for the past 1-2 days, and headache over the last few hours. She
has not had dysuria, hematuria, vomiting, or fevers. No
abdominal pain. No diarrhea.

She does have a history of HTN and is compliant with her

Of note, she had much more severe flank pain 6 weeks ago. She
was told to drink fluids for potential kidney stone. She had
imaging done in [**State 760**], at her home, that showed no obvious
stones. Apparently she was referred to a nephrologist at that
time and was told she had some evidence of kidney failure. She
was first told she may have kidney failure in [**2198-4-22**]. She was
seen by nephrology, but does not know any further details. She
has never been on dialysis before. She did not have this flank
pain at that time.

Patient brought labs from previous appointments.

[**2-4**] Cr 3.07, HCT 31.1.

In the emergency department BP was 221/71. She recived 200mg IV
labetalol and was started on a 1mg/min labetalol gtt. BP came
down to 176/92. HR 77. RR21. O2 sat 88%.

On arrival to the MICU, patient's flank pain is much improved.
No headache, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or shortness of
breath.

Urine cytology ([**3-21**]) - pending

STUDIES:
CT abd/pelvis ([**3-18**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of diverticulosis or urinary tract calculi.
2. Unchanged large calcified fibroid uterus.
3. 2.9-cm low-attenuation left renal lesion larger than prior
study. Further evaluation with MR would be optimal. However,
given the patient's renal failure, US as an initial study is
recommended.

Head CT ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION: No acute intracranial process.

CXR ([**3-18**]): IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary process.
2. Sclerotic focus in the left humeral head, could reflect a
bone island given lack of underlying risk factors for
metastasis. Correlation with prior imaging to confirm stability
is recommended.

Renal US and doppler ([**3-19**]):
FINDINGS: There is a partly cystic/partly solid isoechoic mass
again seen in the mid portion of the left kidney which
corresponds with the recent CT
findings. This mass measures 3.4 x 2.7 x 2.8 cm and demonstrates
some
vascular flow within it on color Doppler imaging. The appearance
of this mass may be suggestive of cystic renal cell carcinoma.
No additional focal
abnormality is seen in the left kidney and there is no
hydronephrosis. The
left kidney measures 9.2 cm. The right kidney measures 10.0 cm.
There is no hydronephrosis and no stone or mass is seen in the
right kidney.

DOPPLER EXAMINATION: Color Doppler and pulse-wave Doppler images
were
obtained. Arterial waveforms of the main renal artery in the
right kidney
demonstrates a slight delay in upstrokes which may indicate some
renal artery stenosis. Sharp upstrokes are identified in the
arterial waveform of the renal artery in the left kidney.
Resistive indices of the intraparenchymal arteries on the right
kidney are slightly elevated ranging from .78-.80. The resistive
indices of the intraparenchymal arteries in the left kidney are
also slightly elevated ranging from .73-.83.

IMPRESSION: 1) Slight upstroke delay of the arterial waveforms
in the main
renal artery of the right kidney may indicate some renal artery
stenosis on the right side. Bilateral moderately elevated RI's.
2. Cystic and solid mass in the mid-left kidney, concerning for
neoplasm.

Bone Scan ([**3-21**]): No scintigraphic evidence of osseous
metastatic disease.

Renal Scan ([**3-26**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Reduced renal function bilaterally consistent with chronic
renal
impairment.
2. Differential renal function of 39% left kidney and 61% right
kidney.


Brief Hospital Course:
59 yo F with hypertensive urgency found to have a new renal
mass.

# Renal mass:  The patient was found to have a new renal mass on
the CT of her abdomen/pelvis done in the ED to evaluate her
flank pain.  On ultrasound the mass was seen to be approximately
2x2x3 cm and had both solid and cystic portions.  The size and
characteristics of the mass are concerning for renal cell
carcinoma.  Her renal mass was thought to account for her flank
pain.

On her admission CXR she was found to have a sclerotc focus in
her left humeral head which was concerning for metastesis.  This
was evaluated with a bone scan which showed no evidence of
metastesis.  Urology was consulted and felt that more
information was needed before a definitive plan for diagnosis
could be developed so a renal scan was preformed to assess the
functionality of her kidneys and showed differential renal
function of 39% from the left kidney and 61% from the right
kidney.

Because she currently has [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable to
schedule outpatient follow-ups for her with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once she moved back to [**State 350**] she was
asked to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to apply
free care through this hospital.  However she was asked to
follow up with her PCP in NJ until this time and an appointment
was made for her with her NJ PCP on [**Name9 (PRE) 766**] [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.
He was contact[**Name (NI) **] and asked to give her a referral to a
nephrologist and urologist in [**State 760**] until she moves her
care to [**State 350**].

# Hypertensive urgency: Her initial BP was 221/71 with worsening
of visual blurring and flank pain. No papilledema on exam.
Patient reports SBPs in 180s for several months and her PCP
notes confirm this.  She states she had been taking her blood
pressure medications regularly, however her PCP notes document
that she often runs out of her medicaitons and has difficulty
regularly taking her medications.  She was on maxed doses of
linsinopril and diovan as an outpatient and large doses of
atenolol.  In the ED she was placed on a labetalol gtt with
decrease in her SBPs.  Renal was consulted and recommended only
starting the lisinopril as it was unclear how compliant she had
been on her previous regimen.  As she remained hypertenisve on
lisinopril, long-acting dilitazem was added and uptitrated to
240 mg daily.  Atenolol was stopped given that it is renally
cleared and diovan was stopped.  She may continue to require
titration of her antihypertensive medications as an outpatient.

# Chronic renal failure: The patient had an admission creatinine
of 3.4. Patient had brought labs with her showing Cr 3.0-3.29 in
[**2198-12-23**]. FENA of 4.24 consistent with intrinsic or
postrenal etiology. This may be consistent with chronic diabetic
or hypertensive nephropathy. CT abdomen showed no stones, or
obvious obstruction. Renal was consulted and recommended
starting sodium bicarbonate 650 mg tid, vitamin D.  She was
given epo while hospitalized for anemia, however this was
stopped at discharge due to concern for insurance reimbursement.
 She was asked to follow up with a nephrologist for further
managment of her renal disease.

# Normocytic Anemia: HCT 30.8. HCT of 31.1 on [**2199-1-20**]. Likely
anemia of chronic renal disease.  She had no evidence of
bleeding.  She was treated with epo per renal as above.  This
remained stable.

# MGUS: As part of the workup for her chronic renal
insufficiency UPEP and SPEP were sent which returned showing a
monoclonal IgG lambda protein spike.  Hematology/oncology were
consulted to ascertain the significance of this finding and they
felt this represented MGUS because the level of protein seen was
small.  There is concern that her kidney disease could be due to
amyloidosis or light chain deposition disease, however a kidney
biopsy would be necessary to diagnosis this and at this time
cannot be preformed given her renal failure.  She will need
yearly UPEP and SPEP to monitor for developement of multiple
myeloma.

# Type 2 Diabetes: The patient is on glipizide as an outpatient.
 This was held while she was hospitalized and she was covered
with a sliding scale, monitored with qid fingersticks, and kept
on a diabetic diet.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Primary -
Renal mass concerning for renal cell carcinoma
Hypertensive urgency
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance
Chronic renal insufficency, Stage IV

Secondary -
Diabetes


Discharge Condition:
Stable


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital due to elevated blood pressure
and back pain.  Your blood pressure was controlled with
medications.  Your scans showed a mass in your left kidney which
was concerning for cancer.  We were also concerned about a mass
seen on your left arm X-ray.  A bone scan done for this was
normal, which is good.

For the kidney mass, we contact[**Name (NI) **] the urologists, who specialize
in kidney surgery.  We did a special kidney scan to take a
closer look at the kidney mass.  You will need to see the
urologists (kidney surgeons) in follow-up after you get
discharged from the hospital.

While you were hospitalized you were also found to have abnormal
protein in your blood and urine.  The cancer specialists were
called and felt you have a disease called Monoclonal Gammopathy
of Unknown Significance (MGUS).  People with this condition have
a small chance of developing a cancer of the blood called
multiple myeloma and need to be screened yearly to check for
this.

Due to your chronic kidney failure you should avoid taking
antiinflammatory medications such as Motrin, Alleve, ibuprofen,
or naproxen.  For pain you can take Tylenol or ask your primary
care physician what to take.

Medication changes:
1.  You were started on diltiazem 240 mg by mouth daily.  You
should take this in addition to lisinopril 40 mg daily for
control of your blood pressure.  It is very important that you
take these medications regularly.
2.  Your diovan and atenolol were stopped.
3.  You were started on sodium bicarbonate 650 mg by mouth three
times daily due to your kidney disease.
4.  You were started on Vitamin D

Followup Instructions:
Because you currently have [**State 760**] Medicaid, we were unable
to schedule outpatient follow-up for you with doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Name5 (PTitle) 764**].  Once you have a place to live in [**State 350**],
you will need to contact Financial Services at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 765**] to
apply free care through this hospital.  However, until that is
arranged, you will need to continue seeing your doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]
[**Name5 (PTitle) **].

An appointment was made for you to follow up with your primary
doctor [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 760**], Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] for a blood pressure and blood
work check on Monday [**4-1**] at 1:00 PM.  You will also need to
ask him for a referral to a kidney specialist (nephrologist) and
a kidney surgeon (urologist) in [**State 760**].

As you will be moving to [**State 350**] soon you can schedule an
appointment with a new primary doctor at [**Hospital6 **]
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**]) once the above are resolved.

It is important that you follow up with urology to discuss a
plan for diagnosis and management of your renal mass.  If you
will be getting care in [**State 350**], please schedule an
appointment with a urologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**], at [**Hospital1 771**]: ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 772**].

You will also need to follow-up with your nephrologist in New
[**Telephone/Fax (1) **].  If you will be transferring your care to [**State 350**],
you can make an appointment with kidney doctors [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Hospital1 771**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 773**].

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to [**Last Name (un) 159**] after undergoing laparoscopic
Right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The
patient was transferred to the ICU in stable condition for
monitoring due to extensive comorbidities and not for any
intraoperative complication.  On POD0, pain was well controlled
on PCA, hydrated for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with
pneumoboots and incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and
ambulated once. She was seen by the cardiology service and the
nephrology service and underwent HD while int he ICU.  On POD1,
the patient was restarted on home medications, basic metabolic
panel and complete blood count were checked, pain control was
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, Foley was removed
without difficulty and diet was advanced as tolerated. Prior to
discharge the patient underwent a CT scan with contrast of the
chest to evaluate pulmonary nodules seen on CXR.  She underwent
HD after this.  The remainder of the hospital course was
relatively unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable
condition, eating well, ambulating independently, voiding
without difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On
exam, incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit
instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] in 3 weeks
and to also call for follow-up with nephrology and cardiology.

Chief Complaint:
respiratory failure

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Bronchoscopy
Intubation
Hemodialysis after HD line placement

History of Present Illness:
61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage IV NSLC lung cancer
(EGFR wild type), DM2, HTN who presents with respiratory
distress.

Patient was with cough and not feeling well this AM. She went to
dialysis where she was coughing intensely to the point that the
needles came out of her AV graft. She appeared short of breath.
Unclear what EMS course was. Upon presentation to the ED, her
eyes were open but she was none verbal. Some history obtained by
cousin in [**Name (NI) **].

Of note, her lung cancer involves the right upper lobe mass and
adjacent hilar/mediastinal/supraclavicular nodes. Patient met
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in [**Month (only) **], who started vinorelbin for
palliative chemotherapy about 2 weeks ago.

In addition, patient's admit weight was 62 kg with an estimated
dry weight of 58 kg.

ED Course:
Initial VS at 11:40 on [**10-21**] were T 97.7 HR 100 BP 181/69 RR 32
Sat 84 %. She triggered for respiratory distress. Eyes were open
but non-verbal. There was a question about intubation/code
status. ED physician spoke to next of [**Doctor First Name **] (Mr.[**Last Name (Titles) 732**]). He stated
that she would want to be intubated. Intubated with 7.5 ETT with
ricironium 60 mg and etomidate 20 mg. Sedation with versed and
propofol. After intubation, VS were 95, 125/59, 25, 99% on vent

CXR revealed RUL opacity. She was given ceftriaxone 1 gm IV x 1
and levofloxacin 750 mg IV x 1 initially followed by addition of
vancomycin 1 gm IV x 1 to cover HCAP. EKG showing Sinus Tach,
TWI V4-6, ? peaked T's.

.
On the floor, patient was sedation and tolerating ventilator
well. Renal was consulted for HD but noticed left graft not
functioning. Placed RIJ line for dialysis access. Dialysis was
going to be performed but hypotensive to MAPs ~ high 50s. CVP 4.
Propofol was switched to versed/fentanyl. Dialysis was not
performed. Patient subsequently underwent bronchoscopy with BAL
showing RL apical segmental occlusion (? tumor), 90 % anterior
segment occlusion, and patent posterior segment. Pressure
subsequently in 180s.

BRONCHIAL WASHING [**2200-10-21**]
NEGATIVE FOR MALIGNANT CELLS.

ADMISSION EKG [**2200-10-21**]
Sinus tachycardia. Intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular
hypertrophy. ST-T wave abnormalities may be due to
intraventricular conduction
delay, left ventricular hypertrophy and possible ischemia.
Clinical
correlation is suggested. Since the previous tracing of [**2200-7-29**]
sinus
tachycardia is now present and ST-T wave abnormalities are more
prominent.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-21**]
IMPRESSION: Multiple limitations as above. There is diffuse and
severe
pulmonary edema. A dense consolidation on the right may indicate
confluent
edema, although pneumonia or underlying mass lesion cannot be
excluded.

ECHO [**2200-10-22**]
The left atrium is normal in size. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Overall left
ventricular systolic function is moderately depressed (LVEF= XX
%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but
aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is
no mitral valve prolapse. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is
seen (within normal limits). The tricuspid valve leaflets are
mildly thickened. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could
not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Mild symmetric LVH with moderate to severe global
hypokinesis. Lateral wall function is relatively better. No
significant mitral regurgitation seen.

CHEST X RAY [**2200-10-24**]
There is now complete opacification of the right upper lung with
increase of
the right mediastinal shift. The findings are consistent with
interval
development of atelectasis but there is potentially some
additional cause that
precludes significant volume loss such as hemorrhage.
Correlation with
bronchoscopy is highly recommended. Position of tubes and lines
and the left
perihilar region opacities are unchanged.


Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and Plan:  61 year-old female with ESRD on HD, Stage
IV NSCLC involving RUL, DM2, HTN who presents with acute
hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress and RUL opacification
secondary to possible post-obstructive pneumonia in addition to
initial neutropenia.
.
# Hypercarbic/hypoxic respiratory distress
Ms. [**Known lastname 784**] was originally intubated and ventilated in the ICU
setting upon admission.  After initially failing pressure
support trial, she was ultimately able to be extubated on
[**2200-10-23**] after a discussion with the family concluded that if
Patient extubated initially failing trial of pressure support.
Cause of the respiratory distress thought to be likely
multifactorial with RUL opacification representing
post-obstructive pneumonia given bronchscopy and ? pulmonary
edema contribution although not clinically evident
(?lymphangitic spread of cancer).  Per goals of care
conversation with the family and HCP, the decision was made to
not reintubate, and ultimately, she was made CMO.  She was kept
comfortable with morphine concentrated oral solution and
scopolamine patch was used for secretion control.  She was
started on a morphine gtt with bolus morphine for breakthrough
[**12-24**] tachypnea on [**2200-10-27**]. The patient passed away on [**2200-10-27**].
.
# Sepsis secondary to post-obstructive pneumonia with subsequent
pan-sensitive E. Coli bacteremia. Patient with leukocytosis and
fever (100.7) during MICU stay.  She was originally treated with
vanc/levofloxacin however this was changed to Zosyn after cx
data returned.  Upon admission, she was neutropenic [**Last Name (un) 834**]
vinrelbin chemo 2 weeks PTA. This resolved over time.  The
source of her bacteremia was thought most likely [**12-24**] pulmonary
system.  After the decision was made to become CMO, antibiotics
were discontinued and she was kept comfortable with tylenol
liquid prn for fever.
.
# Non-gap mixed respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis.
Metabolic acidosis resolved s/p dialysis. Continued to have
respiratory acidosis likely secondary to hypoventilation
post-extubation.  ABGs and blood draws to monitor lytes and K
were discontinued after the patient was made CMO.
.
# Hypotension: Patient had issues with pre-load dependent
hypotension during her MICU course. Patient appeared adequately
resuscitated and a recent ECHO showed moderate to severe
hypokinesis, which may represent myocardial depression [**12-24**] to
sepsis and acute illness vs. baseline heart disease.  After the
patient was made CMO, dialysis was discontinued and vital signs
were no longer taken.

# EKG changes: TWI different from prior on admission. In state
of acute illness, demand ischemia possible. EKG changes resolved
by morning. Troponins bland. Acute plaque rupture very unlikely.
Many of her cardiac medications were stopped during her MICU
stay, and were not restarted given her CMO status (ASA, plavix,
lipitor, heparin gtt, ACE/BB).
.
# Chronic kidney disease requiring HD.  HD was performed by
renal during her MICU stay.  Medications were renally dosed, and
nephrotoxins and IV contrast were avoided in the setting of CKD.
 HD was discontinued when the patient was made CMO.
.
# Stage IV NSCLC
- discussed with primary oncologist (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], who thinks
chemotherapy unlikely to provide patient any benefit.
.
# Anemia
Baseline Hgb ~ 11. Current stable around ~ 8. No evidence of
acute blood loss.
This was trended, but after the patient was made CMO, no more
labs were checked.
.
# Chronic heart failure, systolic, EF 30 % with MR. [**Name13 (STitle) **] does
not have active signs of heart failure although transient
diastolic function can cause pulmonary edema. ECHO showed
resolving MR.
.
# History of reactive airway disease: continued on ipratropium
nebs, until CMO status, at which point they were d/c'ed as
family felt pt did not derive help with them.
.
# Diabetes - pt did not receive oral hypoglycemics, but rather
was placed on a SSI until this was stopped when she was made
CMO.
.
# Goals of care
Multiple family meetings held (see ICU attending note for more
details). Per HCP, DNR/[**Name2 (NI) 835**] with no pressors. Given that her
health deteriorated during her MICU stay, the patient was made
CMO by the family including her HCP in light of the
post-obstructive pneumonia difficult to treat in the setting of
Stage IV NSCLC.  She was transferred to the medicine floor after
lines were d/c'ed.  All vital sign checks and lab draws were
discontinued, and the family remained at the bedside.  The
patient was prescribed only medications for comfort, which
included tylenol liquid, morphine sulfate concentrated oral
solution, ativan, and haldol.
.
Of note, SW saw the pt and provided counseling to the family
throughout her stay on [**Wardname 836**].

Service:  CCU


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 66-year-old man with
severe CAD, status post CABG in [**2135**] with recent PCI to the
LMCA and SVG to the PDL in [**2143-7-14**].  He presented on
[**2143-8-23**] for an elective intervention brachytherapy of the
SVG to PL and native RCA.  The patient reported that he had
been feeling well without chest pain, shortness of breath, or
dyspnea on exertion.  He was noted to have an ejection
fraction of greater than 60 percent in [**2143-7-14**].  The
patient underwent a cardiac catheterization on the morning of
arrival with PCI to the native RCA and 4 stents and
brachytherapy to the vein graft.  The patient tolerated the
procedure well and approximately 6 hours later developed a
chest pain noted as 4 out of 10 substernal radiating to his
throat and back without shortness of breath, diaphoresis,
nausea or vomiting.  EKG at that time revealed ST elevation
in II, III, and aVF.  The patient was brought back to the
catheterization laboratory at that time.  They found that the
SVG to PL have been thrombosed.  The artery was opened in the
catheterization laboratory, AngioJet had been unsuccessful
and the graft was opened with Nipride with subsequent TIMI 3
flow.  The patient had persistently occluded communication
between the native RCA and the vein graft.  Postprocedure,
after the sheath pull, a hematoma developed and the patient
had baseline low blood pressure of systolic in the 90s.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Status post MI in [**2129**].
2. PCI to the LAD in [**2130**].
3. PCI to the RCA in [**2132**], complicated by a stent blocking
   the femoral artery.
4. Status post iliac repair.
5. Coronary artery bypass graft in [**2135**] including LIMA to the
   LAD, SVG to the D1, SVG to the RPL.
6. PCI to the LMCA in [**2143-7-14**], PCI to the SVG to the PVL.
7. Status post right knee arthroscopy.
8. History of hemorrhoids.
9. History of benign polyps.


MEDICATIONS ON PRESENTATION:
1. Aspirin 325 mg a day.
2. Lopressor 12.5 mg b.i.d.
3. Zocor 60 mg a day.
4. Plavix 75 mg a day.


ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Smokes 10 packs a week for the past 50
years, currently trying to quit.  Social tobacco with no
illicits.

FAMILY HISTORY:  A brother died of MI at age 60.  Father had
his first MI in his 50s.  The patient is married with several
children.  He is currently between jobs.  After the
procedure, the patient was admitted to the CCU for
monitoring.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature was 98.2 degrees,
blood pressure 99/48, respiratory rate 15, 100 percent
saturation on room air, heart rate 57 to 66.  In general, he
is a well-appearing elderly male, alert and oriented with an
appropriate affect.  HEENT revealed no JVD.  Supple neck.
Chest revealed clear lungs, no rhonchi, no crackles.
Cardiovascular normal S1, S2, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops,
no S3 or S4.  Abdomen is flat, soft, nontender, nondistended,
with normoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are warm with
capillary refill less than 3 seconds, 2 plus DP and PT and
radial pulses, no edema, left groin with bruit.

LABORATORY DATA:  EKG on presentation had a sinus rate of 55,
inferior T-wave inversions, ST elevation in V1 and V2.

IMPRESSION:  The patient is a 66-year-old male with a severe
CAD, status post brachytherapy, SVG to the PDL with
subsequent thrombosis, status post opening of the artery
during repeat catheterization.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was now hemodynamically stable
with resolution of his EKG changes and ST elevation and he
was admitted to the CCU for monitoring.  That evening, the
patient complained of back pain on his left side, which he
attributed to lying on his back.  On exam, there was no
palpable hematoma, no bruit auscultated and strong DP pulses
with warm extremities.  The CT of the pelvis and abdomen was
negative for retroperitoneal bleed.  It was determined that
the patient's pain was due to back pain; however, the concern
for his low blood pressure, lack of evidence for
retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient was bolused 250 cc of IV
fluid and blood pressure increased to a range of 98 to
106/50s to 60s.  The patient was also noted to have
hematocrit of 29.5, he was transfused 1 unit.  After his
catheterization, the patient had prolonged groin bleeding
requiring a clamp; as stated the ultrasound was noted a small
hematoma without aneurysm and a CT was negative for
retroperitoneal bleed.  The patient had been having low blood
pressure persistently.  There was no evidence of a tamponade,
no evidence for bleeding, no evidence for adrenal
insufficiency and the patient responded well to small boluses
of fluid.  This was presumably all due to preload dependent.
The patient had 3 beats of NSVT on telemetry and otherwise
was feeling quite well; had no recurrence of chest pain.
Given persistent hypotension, the patient remained in the
intensive care unit for 24 more hours.  He was given a
cosyntropin stimulation test to rule out adrenal
insufficiency.  It was inconclusive.  He was given
hydrocortisone 100 mg for empiric treatment and there was no
effect on blood pressure; therefore, it was determined that
it was highly unlikely his low blood pressure was due to
adrenal insufficiency and likely was extensive vagal
phenomenon from pressure on the groin status post procedure.
Given that the patient was doing well, he was transferred out
to the floor on day 3.  Blood pressure remained low at
90s/60s.  The patient continued to receive boluses with mild
effective increase; however, the patient had profoundly good
urine output and urine lytes that supported the patient being
euvolemic.  The patient ambulated well, had no complaints.
He was restarted back on his home medications including his
blood pressure medications.  For his coronary artery disease,
which was extensive, the patient's CK has declined, he was
maintained on aspirin, Plavix and Lipitor at 80.  He was
restarted on his Lopressor before going home and tolerated
that well without any difficulty with hypotension.  The
patient was consulted extensively on smoking cessation.  The
patient had a repeat echocardiogram that revealed an EF 50 to
55 percent, mild inferior wall hypokinesis compared to the
previous study and it was hoped that he would restart on Ace
inhibitor and titrated up on that in time as his blood
pressure tolerated as an outpatient.  For anemia, the
patient's hematocrit remained stable.  It was determined that
he has a small arterial bleed status post catheterization;
received 1 unit of blood.  No evidence of AV fistula.  The
patient was instructed to have his hematocrit followed up by
his primary care doctor.  The patient's hypotension was
determined to be due to vagal phenomenon.  The patient was
near his baseline blood pressure.  There was no evidence of
adrenal insufficiency and the patient was asymptomatic.  He
was discharged with plans to have his blood pressure checked
and to titrate up his medications as tolerated.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient was discharged to home
with instructions to take Plavix every day as ordered or
stent would close.  He was instructed to never smoke again.
He was instructed regarding his new medications.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1. Coronary artery disease.
2. Acute stent thrombosis, status post cardiac
   catheterization and stenting.
3. Anemia due to blood loss.
4. Groin hematoma.
5. Hypotension.
6. Hypokalemia.
7. Tobacco use.


FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to followup with his
cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 837**], on [**2143-11-27**].  He was instructed to
have another stress test according to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 837**] on [**2143-11-18**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted and placed on
Ampicillin, Levofloxacin, and Flagyl.  Blood cultures were
sent.  On hospital day #1, [**2188-8-15**], the patient
underwent partial gastrectomy and gastrojejunostomy with
placement of feeding J-tube for a perforated gastric ulcer.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and there were no
complications during the surgery.  The patient was placed in
the Intensive Care Unit over night, intubated.  On [**2188-8-16**], postoperative day #1, the patient was weaned from
ventilator support and extubated without difficulty.  The
patient's renal function improved to producing over 30 cc/hr
and soft bowel sounds were appreciated.  On postoperative day
#3 the patient was transferred to the floor.  On the floor,
the patient was started on half-strength tube feeds.  Total
parenteral nutrition was continued and by [**8-21**],
postoperative day #6 the patient was tolerating sips.  On the
day of [**8-20**], the patient had one episode of atrial
fibrillation that was successfully controlled with
intravenous Lopressor.  By [**8-22**], the patient was
tolerating liquids without difficulty.  Total parenteral
nutrition had been stopped, antibiotics had been stopped and
rehabilitation planning had started.  Tube feeds were
increased to almost goal.  On [**8-23**], the patient was
tolerating full liquids without difficulty and was discharged
to rehabilitation.  The patient will be discharged to
[**Hospital **] Rehabilitation in good condition.  She is able to
ambulate with assistance, tolerate full liquids and has no
further need for antibiotics.

IMAGING:
CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-15**]):
IMPRESSION:
1. Large amount of fecal packing within the colon throughout the
colon. Mild to moderate dilitation of several loops of jejunum
with concern for partial obstruction. Complete obstruction is
not present as some contrast travels into the proximal colon.
2. Large fluid distention of the stomach with reflux of fluid
into the distal esophagus. Placement of NG tube is recommended
for decompression. A proximal obstruction cannot be excluded as
contrast was administered through the jejunostomy tube.

Abdominal XRay ([**6-22**]):
IMPRESSION:
Nonspecific bowel gas pattern. There are dilated loops of small
bowel within the abdomen as well as air and stool seen
throughout the colon.

CXR ([**6-23**]): FINDINGS: Comparison is made to the previous study
from [**2164-6-22**].
There is an endotracheal tube whose tip is 4.7 cm above the
carina
appropriately sited. The left-sided IJ central venous catheter
has the distal tip in the proximal SVC and is also unchanged.
Since the previous study, there has been development of diffuse
airspace opacities, mostly at the lung bases, which can be
compatible with the suggested history of aspiration. No
pneumothoraces are seen.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**6-25**]): CONCLUSION:
1. Significant small bowel dilatation. The configuration raises
the
possibility of a closed loop obstruction. with narrowing of a
single segment, concerning for obstruction. Interval development
of ascites may also support small bowel obstruction.
2. Bilateral airspace consolidation.
3. Interval development of ascites.

Abdominal Pathology ([**6-27**]): Ileum, segmental resection:
1.  Ischemic enteritis with stricture.
2.  Proximal dilation and focal hemorrhage.
3.  The margins are free of disease.

CT Abdomen/Pelvis ([**7-10**]): IMPRESSION:
1. Marked interval improvement in the small-bowel obstruction
noted on [**2164-6-25**] with passage of contrast predominantly up
to the splenic flexure of colon.
2. Apparant 2.1 X 4.4 cm loculated fluid collection as described
above could represent a fluid filled pelvic ileal loop. Short
term follow-up pelvic CT with oral contrast to evaluate for
change or filling is suggested to aid differentiaion.
3. Improved bibasilar atelectasis and patchy ground glass and
tree-and-[**Male First Name (un) 239**]
opacities suggesting resolving infectious process. New small
bilateral pleural effusions are noted.

CT Pelvis ([**7-11**]):
IMPRESSION: The previously described possible fluid collection
on today's
study appears to be a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic
abscess
measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm (AP, transverse, craniocaudal). No
other short term interval changes.

Brief Hospital Course:
1. SBO:
Pt was initially found to not have an obstruction or
intra-abdominal free air. Pt was made NPO with an NGT and IVF.
The patient pulled out his NGT and was subsequently placed on UE
restraints. The NGT was not replaced as the patient subsequently
had copious large bowel movements initially. At the time, Pt's
lab values during the initial period, including CBC and
electrolytes were all normal throughout the hosptial course.
However, over the next few days, he continued to have trouble
with SBO, and a significant high-grade bowel obstruction distal
from the J-tube site was found on Abd CT on [**6-25**]. We tried to
care for this with 2 days of
conservative therapy, including venting of the J tube and NG
decompression. There was clearly no progression of his
distention, and he was not making bowel movements, and since he
is noncommunicative, the decision was made to not delay any
further and operate on him.
On [**6-27**], he went to the OR for:
1. Small bowel exploratory laparotomy.
2. Small-bowel resection with primary anastomosis.
Post-operatively, an NGT was placed, and he was put on bowel
rest. By [**7-2**], he was passing stools, and his NGT output was
decreased until it came out and it was not replaced. Tubefeeds
through J tube were restarted on [**7-3**] and his goal was met on
[**7-5**]. He did fail a swallow study on [**7-4**], and he has remained
NPO. He did have some anemia to 20.8 on [**7-3**], and was given
2URBCs which he responded well to.

The patient seemed to be more somnolent and less responsive on
[**7-10**], and he had a repeat CT abdomen/pelvis which showed
interval improvement in his SBO, but also a 2.1 X 4.4 cm
loculated fluid collection as described above could represent a
fluid filled pelvic ileal loop. A subsequent Pelvic CT with PO
contrast showed a loculated pocket of ascites or intrapelvic
abscess measuring 2.7 x 4.8 x 2.2 cm. The surgeons (including
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] reviewed the films and determined that this was
unlikely to be an abscess, and there was no need to take him for
CT guided drainage or back to the OR.

2. C. Difficle Colitis:
On HD 2 the patient was found to have stool positive for C.Diff.
He was started on flagyl PO 500 TID for a course fo 2 weeks then
switched to PO vancomycin 250mg every 6 hrs on [**6-17**] for total 14
day treatment.  Pt completed his course of PO vanco on [**7-1**], and
was not having diarrhea at that time. Repeat C. diff stool
cultures on [**8-17**], [**7-5**], and [**7-11**] were negative.

3. Seizures:
The patient was found to be tachycardic and hypertensive on HD
2. In context of his PMH, it was believed that he likely had a
seizure. It was noted that he was having between 1 and 3
seizures daily at his current home prior to admission. Dilantin
levels were checked daily and often found to be subtherapeutic.
400 mg boluses of dilantin were given accordingly and the
neurology service at [**Hospital1 18**] was consulted for appropriate
management of his seizures. The patient was transferred to the
Neurology service on HD4.

While on neuro service, he had no increase in his usual seizure
frequency.
Post-operatively, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was maintained on IV Dilantin and
Lorazepam, and his dilantin levels were followed. By [**7-5**], he
was restarted on Dilantin, Lorazepam, Felbatol, and Trileptal
through J tube per Neurology.

His Keppra was discontinued during this hospitalization. His
Phenytoin was changed to 100 mg three times a day. His Trileptal
was kept at 300-600-300, and his Felbatol was kept at 1400 mg
[**Hospital1 **]. He was started on Ativan 1 mg PO q8 hr. IN ONE WEEK THIS
SHOULD BE TAPERED TO 1 MG PO Q12 HR, and will be further
titrated during his follow up appointment with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 856**].

4. Upper GI Bleed: On [**6-22**], pt had black vomitus which was
guaiac positive hence NGT was placed and pt had copious black
fluid output which was once again guaiac positive.  Pt did not
have any IV access and peripheral access could not be obtained
hence L IJ central line was placed per medical procedure team.
Pt had stat CBC, type and screen and IV PPI [**Hospital1 **] was started and
GI was consulted who recommended CT scan to rule out
obstruction.  Surgery was contact[**Name (NI) **] given that pt was initially
admitted per surgery and recently had ex-lap, cholecystectomy
and open j tube placement per Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Pt became
hemodynamically unstable with decreasing BP and tachycardia plus
decreased urine output, pt was transferred to MICU for intensive
care.

5. Aspiration Pneumonia: While in the MICU, he developed
respiratory failure, which was likely aspiration given
significant amounts of gastric contents from OG tube after
intubation. CXR [**6-25**] showed increased prominence of the airspace
consolidations at both bases, consistent with pneumonia. He was
treated with Vancomycin/Cefepime. Repeat CXR on [**7-10**] showed
marked improvement compared to 10 days prior with small residual
right lower lobe consolidation

6. Hyponatremia: Sodium nadired at 128, but was 130 at the time
of discharge. He has a history of hyponatremia secondary to
Trileptal use. Nutrition changed his tube feeds to Probalance to
decrease the amount of free water he was taking in.

7. Thrombocytosis: His platelets peaked at 1255, and were 974 at
the time of discharge. This was thought to be a reactive
thrombocytosis secondary to an underlying process, and not a
primary bone marrow disorder.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital3 7**] & Rehab Center - [**Hospital1 8**]

Discharge Diagnosis:
PRIMARY:
C. difficile colitis
SBO from adhesions
Ischemic bowel
GI bleed
Hyponatremia likely secondary to Trileptal
Reactive Thrombocytosis

SECONDARY:
[**Location (un) 849**]-Gastaut syndrome
Mental retardation
s/p recent J-tube placement


Discharge Condition:
Stable, nonverbal, moving all extremities against gravity,
tracks eyes past midline, no obvious abdominal pain


Discharge Instructions:
You presented to the hospital with C. difficile colitis, and
this treated with antibiotics. You then had hematemesis and your
blood pressure became low, consistent with an upper GI bleed. GI
and surgery were consulted, and you were taken to the OR. You
had an exploratory laparotomy, and were found to have an SBO
secondary to adhesions and ischemic bowels s/p resection and
primary anastamosis. You were in the ICU under the care of the
surgeons during this part of your hospitalization. You were then
transferred back to the floor, and were under the care of the
neurologists. Your sodium remained low (130 at the time of
discharge) during this hospitalization which is likely secondary
to Trileptal use. Because of this, nutrition changed your tube
feeds to Probalance to decrease the amount of free water you
were receiving (and increase your kilocalories). Your platelet
count was elevated to the 1000s, which is likely a reactive
thrombocytosis. Speech and Swallow evaluated you, and
recommended you remain NPO with supplemental nutrition.

Your Flagyl course was completed while you were in the hospital,
so you no longer need to take this medication. You were started
on Metoprolol 62.5 mg PO three times a day, because your heart
rate was fast during the hospitalization. Your Keppra was
discontinued. Your Phenytoin was changed to 100 mg three times a
day. You were started on Ativan 1 mg PO q8 hr. IN ONE WEEK THIS
SHOULD BE TAPERED TO 1 MG PO Q12 HR. Any further titration will
be determined when he follows up with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 856**] in
Neurology.

If you develop increased frequency of seizures, decreased
responsiveness, abdominal pain, increased frequency of diarrhea,
fevers/chills, or any other symptoms that concern you, call your
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 850**], or return to the ED.

Followup Instructions:
You have a follow up appointment with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 856**] in
Neurology ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 857**]) on [**2164-8-1**] at 9:00 am in the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**]

.
[**2164-11-23**] EKG: Sinus tachycardia at 100 bpm with delayed R wave
progression which is non-specific. Compared to the previous
tracing of [**2164-9-5**] there is no significant change.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CXR: FINDINGS: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is
within normal limits given leftward rotation. No radiographic
evidence of pneumonia is detected. Pulmonary vascularity appears
within normal limits. No effusion or pneumothorax. Arm in the
down position limits evaluation on the lateral
radiograph. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence of pneumonia
given limitations.
.
[**2164-11-23**] CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST: FINDINGS: There is no evidence of
hemorrhage, edema, masses, mass effect, or infarction. The
ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with early
involutional changes. No acute fractures are identified. The
visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are well
aerated. IMPRESSION: No evidence of acute intracranial process.
.
[**2164-11-23**] PORTABLE ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Single frontal radiograph
of the abdomen shows a non-obstructive nondilated bowel gas
pattern. There is no free gas or pneumatosis. A mild amount of
retained fecal material is present. Visualized osseous
structures are unremarkable and there are no soft tissue
calcifications. IMPRESSION: 1. No radiographic evidence of toxic
megacolon.
.
[**2164-11-26**] RIGHT ANKLE X-RAY: FINDINGS: Four views of the right
ankle are submitted. Screw tracts are present in the distal
fibula and there is residual osseous deformity from prior
fracture. The fracture is healed. The talus is abnormally
rotated with respect to the calcaneus and there is a medial
talar tilt. There is abnormal varus angulation of the foot. No
osseous findings to suggest osteomyelitis at this time.
.
[**2164-11-30**] ABD X-RAY: FINDINGS: Two frontal and two lateral
decubitus radiographs of the abdomen are interpreted in
comparison with radiograph from [**2164-11-23**]. Images show
an air-filled colon with associated minimal dilatation. Note is
made of a paucity of bowel gas in the area of the rectum.
Decubitus view show scattered air-fluid levels within the colon.
The small bowel shows scattered air-filled loops with no
dilatation. There is no free air and there is no pneumatosis.
Tiny pelvic phlebolith is seen as well as a 10 x 7 mm ovoid
calcific density in the deep pelvis which is unchanged when
compared to CT studies from [**2164-5-13**]. Visualized osseous
structures are notable for a mild dextroconvex lumbar curvature.
IMPRESSION: Air-filled loop of colon with minimal dilatation,
though a paucity of gas is seen in the rectum and distal sigmoid
overall concerning for possible obstruction in the appropriate
clinical setting.
.
[**2164-11-30**] CT ABD/PELVIS W/ CONTRAST:
- CT ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: There are left greater
than right bibasilar opacities, likely representing atelectasis,
left basal opacity is slightly more concerning for aspiration.
There is thickening of the distal esophagus. The liver, spleen,
adrenal glands, pancreas are unremarkable. Kidneys enhance
equally and excrete contrast normally. There is no free air, no
free fluid, no pathologically enlarged mesenteric or
retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Abdominal loops of small bowel are
not dilated. The contrast passes through the small bowel into
the colon, reaching distal transverse colon. There is fecal
material and gas noted throughout the descending colon as well
as gas present in the rectum. Normal appendix is seen. The cecum
is very large and displaces the sigmoid colon.
- CT PELVIS WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST: The rectum, sigmoid colon
are unremarkable. Urinary bladder wall demonstrates concentric
thickening, which may be due to underdistension, chronic UTI can
have this appearance. There is no pelvic fluid and no
pathologically enlarged pelvic or inguinal lymph nodes.
Bilateral inguinal nodes measure up to 9 mm in short axis
diameter. The prostate is enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse
dimension.
- BONE WINDOWS: Demonstrate no concerning lytic or sclerotic
lesions. Anterior compression deformity of T12 vertebral body is
stable.
- IMPRESSION:
1. No evidence of small bowel obstruction or stool impaction.
Distended cecum with mass effect on the sigmoid, intermittent
obstruction may be result.
2. Bibasilar atelectasis, left lower lobe opacity is concerning
for aspiration if the patient is at risk.
3. Concentric urinary bladder wall thickening, greater in extent
compared to the prior study. Cystitis can also have this
appearance; outlet obstruction less likely given more normal
appearance on [**2164-6-12**] studies.

[**2164-12-3**] ENDOSCOPY:Erythema and congestion and superficial
erosion in the gastroesophageal junction compatible with mild
esophagitis
Mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus (biopsy) Erythema and
congestion in the stomach body and antrum compatible with mild
gastritis (biopsy) Normal mucosa in the first part of the
duodenum, second part of the duodenum and third part of the
duodenum (biopsy) Small hiatal hernia

Brief Hospital Course:
49 year-old man with a history of presumed [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut
Syndrome and epilepsy presents with a in the setting of fever.
.
# Seizures: Patient has a well-known seizures history due to
[**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut, although his [**Location (un) 850**] believes his
presentation may have been due to an episode of rigors in the
setting of fever and leukocytosis. Corrected phenytoin level was
9.1 on admission, and he received additional phenytoin 300 mg IV
x 1. CT head negative. Infectious work-up remarkable only for
UTI, for which pt completed a 7-day course of
amoxicillin/ampicillin. He was switched back to outpatient oral
phenytoin dose but continued to have seizures lasting up to half
a minute, which was determined by neurology to be consistent
with baseline seizures. Rechecked corrected phenytoin level was
5, and pt given additional bolus of phenytoin 150 mg IV and then
started on increased dose of phenytoin 150 mg po bid. Phenytoin
and albumin levels should be followed to ensure therapeutic
level of [**9-26**]; level was 7.2 on day of discharge, neurology
called, recommended rechecking level in [**12-14**] weeks with albumin.
.
# Fever/Leukocytosis: Per [**Date Range 850**], patient with fevers on
and off for months so fever work-up initiated. Lactate nl, RF
slightly elevated. CXR negative. Vancomycin discontinued as LP
without evidence. Ceftriaxone stopped and continued on
ampicillin/amoxicillin (dependent on NPO status) for UTI, which
grew out VRE. As patient initially still spiking fevers with
markedly elevated CRP, R foot x-ray done to rule out R ankle
osteomyelitis given history of this. Patient subsequently
defervesced and leukocytosis resolved. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed left greater than right bibasilar opacities, likely
representing atelectasis, but left basal opacity slightly more
concerning for aspiration. Unable to correlate with exam as
limited by cooperation but as pt remained afebrile off
antibiotics and as evaluated on this admission by Speech/Swallow
with no signs of aspiration, did not pursue further work-up.
Would recommend repeat CXR if pt does spike a new fever.
.
# Enterococcus UTI: As above, completed 7-day course of
antibiotics.
.
# ?Aspiration pneumonia: Reevaluated by Speech/Swallow on this
admission with no evidence of aspiration with thin liquids.
Recommended to continue ground diet, thin liquids, and whole
pills mixed with food. Questionable left-sided aspiration
pneumonia on CT abd/pelvis as above; would repeat CXR if pt
spikes new fever.
.
# R/o Barrett's esophagus: Pt scheduled for outpatient endoscopy
to evaluate this but done as inpatient. Of note, CT abd/pelvis
showed thickening of the distal
esophagus. Pt underwent endoscopy on [**2164-12-3**] which showed
concern for Barrett's esophagus.  Biopsies will need to be
followed up.
.
# Anemia: Hct remained stable but given h/o iron deficiency
anemia also seen on labs on this admission, pt repleted with IV
iron and discharged with oral iron supplements. Attempt made to
perform colonoscopy as inpatient given this and as pt nearing
routine screening age but was hampered by inadequate bowel prep
despite prolonged efforts involving multiple bottles of mag
citrate and tap water enemas. Would still recommend pursuing in
the long run given persistent iron deficiency anemia and
possibility of detecting colon cancer at an early stage.
.
# Constipation: Pt inadequately bowel prepped for colonoscopy
likely secondary to high rectal stool impaction out of reach
manually. However, abdomen soft with no evidence of obstruction
on CT abd/pelvis. Would recommend maintaining a good, regular
bowel regimen daily as outpatient to prevent stool impaction,
especially in anticipation of need for outpatient colonoscopy in
the future.
.
# Enlarged prostate: Per CT abdomen/pelvis, the prostate is
enlarged up to 5 cm in transverse dimension. Pt able to void
bladder. Would follow up as outpatient.
.
# Transaminitis: Mild elevation which subsequently resolved.
Abdominal exam benign. [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to med effect v.
viral infection. Viral hepatitis panel negative.
.
# Peripheral neuropathy: Thought to be secondary to dilantin.
Continued on outpatient Vitamin B12
.
# Mental Retardation: Mental status at baseline as per attendant
from group home.

Brief Hospital Course:
49 y/o M with a history of [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome who is
nonverbal at baseline who presents with fever and associated
vomiting for 1 day and a leukocytosis, with exam, oxygen
requirement, and imaging consistent with health-care associated
pneumonia.

1. Pneumonia: Patient presented with fever to 101 and
leukocytosis with a CXR consistent with left base consolidation
and a new supplemental O2 requirement. Was found to be
hypotensive in the ED, although volume responsive and was
normotensive on arrival to the MICU. Although a nursing home
resident, he was initially covered in the ED with vanco,
ceftriaxone, and azithromycin, and he defervesced overnight and
so was continued on this regimen at the time of transfer to the
regular floors. Blood cultures drawn in the ED prior to
antibiotics were negative. On the floor, pt had fever to 100.8
and was broadened to vancomcyin, zosyn and azithromycin. He lost
IV access and was briefly transitioned to PO regimen with
linezolid, flagyl, and levofloxacin.  He did well for >36 hours
with no fever or leukocytosis on this oral regimen so decision
was made to contiune treatment on oral antibiotics to be
completed at home.  Repeat CXR in [**2-13**] weeks recommended to
ensure complete resolution.

2.  [**Location (un) 849**] Gastaut Syndrome: At best pt has [**4-17**] sz/wk and can
often have daily seizures. Was continued on home anti-epileptic
regimen including phenytoin, keppra, and felbatol. Dilantin
levels were measured and were therapeutic. Pt did not have any
seizures during hospitalization.

3. Anemia: baseline of 30-33. Hct at baseline during admission.
He has a history of chronic GI bleeds, had several guaiac
positive stools during admission, however Hct stable throughout
hospitalization. On ferrous sulfate TID usually, but was changed
to daily considering h/o constipation.

4. Dysphagia: Continued a ground diet with thickened liquids and
pills crushed in ice cream or applesauce, at the time of
discharge he was tolerating his diet well

5. Diarrhea: pt with several loose stools during admission, C
diff negative x 3.  Resolved at time of discharge.

6. Barrett's Esophagus: Continued [**Hospital1 **] PPI.

7. Osteoporosis: stable, continued his TUMS

8. Peripheral Neuropathy: remained stable, continued vitamin B12

9. Prophylaxis: Patient received heparin products during
admission.

Chief Complaint:
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
colonoscopy x 2 (+1 failed [**12-23**] poor prep)
Tagged RBC GI bleeding study

History of Present Illness:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C. Diff who presents with
bloody diarrhea for 2 weeks. States is constipated at baseline
(1 BM qod), and has a h/o hemorrhoids so she initially thought
her bloody diarrhea was hemorrhoidal bleeding. Her BM frequency
increased to 2-3BM's day from baseline. The color was darker
than normal for her. The diarrhea was unusually malordorous. She
came to [**Hospital1 18**] because she just wasn't getting better and was fed
up with wearing sanitary pads. Also worried because her sister
passed away from colon CA last year (age 81). Denies any
abdominal pain or N/V. No CP, no SOB. She has been tolerating
POs normally but notes a slightly decreased appetite and weight
loss of 5 pounds. Feels tired and weak but denies dizziness or
lightheadedness. No recent hospitalizations but was hospitalized
last year in [**Month (only) **] for pneumonia, developed C. Diff which
required 3 months of treatment.
.
In the ER she was found to have a hct of 38 (baseline), she had
guaiac positive melena on exam. She received 1L NS. GI was
called and recommended CT abdomen with contrast, which was
negative for colitis, showed patent arteries, and showed
diverticulosis without diverticulitis. They recommended
colonoscopy in AM, and she was begun on GoLytely prep. However,
the patient did not tolerate this and was changed to Mag
Citrate. She also received 1 unit of PRBCs.
.
On admission to the fllor she feels well but weak. BMs are still
dark, mixed with blood.

Past Medical History:

GI BLEEDING STUDY  [**2192-5-24**]
IMPRESSION: Bleeding from the distal sigmoid/rectum.
.
ECHO [**5-24**]
Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left ventricular cavity
size is normal. Left ventricular systolic function is
hyperdynamic (EF>75%). There is a severe resting left
ventricular outflow tract obstruction (peak gradient >150 mmHg)
in the setting of hyperdynamic state. Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The ascending aorta is
mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is systolic anterior motion
of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**11-22**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern
suggests impaired relaxation. The pulmonary artery systolic
pressure could not be determined. There is no
pericardial effusion.


Brief Hospital Course:
83yo woman with h/o diverticulosis, C.Diff, presented with
bloody diarrhea x 2 weeks. Infectious causes ruled out (neg
CDiff, campy, salm, shig), and CT negative for mesenteric
ischemia. Colonoscopy [**5-21**] found a bleeding sigmoid diverticulum
that was injected with epinephrine with good hemostasis. In
setting of GIB anemia and demand ischemia, pt suffered mild
NSTEMI. Pt began to pass bloody stools again, necessitating RBC
transfusions to maintain HCT. Tagged RBC study showed rebleed in
sigmoid colon not amenable to angio. GI re-scoped on [**5-25**], which
showed normal colon with no bleeding. Pt.'s HCT remained stable
until disharge and did not have further bleeding.
.
# GIB: Presented with 2 weeks of bleeding at home. Infectious
etiologies ruled out. Mesenteric ischemia ruled out by CT.
Diverticular bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but
patient with continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid
on tagged RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to
angio intervention. She continued to be supported with aggresive
pRBC trasfusions until her repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] which
showed a no source of bleeding. She did not have any further
bloody BMs and was hemodyamically stable as of [**2192-5-29**].
.
# CHEST PAIN: Patient has had negative CKs but small troponin
leak, ? 1mm ST depressions on EKG from [**5-21**]. Likely represents
mild NSTEMI from demand ischemia, as tends to recur only when
patient drops her hematocrit to the mid 20's. Cardiology
consulted, agree that this represents demand ischemia, recommend
agressive transfusion. Echo obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall
motion abnormalities. ASA was initally given but held per GI
recommendations. Patient was put on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **] in the
setting of her NSTEMI. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as
outpatient [**2192-6-5**].
.
#SOB: after aggressive volume resuscitation and blood
transfusions, the patient began to experience SOB and tachypnea.
A CXR was c/w volume overload and CHF. She was treated with
Lasix 10mg x 2, which excellent diuretic effect and symptomatic
relief. Pt. was started on Lasix 20mg QD on discharge.
.
# HTN: We held her diuretic throughout her stay in the setting
of her GIB, and restarted B blocker during her admission
(metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]). Her home diltiazem was held.
.
# BRONCHIECTASIS: Continued on home meds of albuterol MDI prn,
spiriva qd. Added albuterol/atrovent nebulizers.
.
# PPX: Received PPI, avoided heparin throughout given her bleed,
used pneumoboots.
.
# FEN: Although often NPO for procedures, she ate a heart
healthy cardiac diet. IV NS as necessary.

[**2192-6-5**]: GI Bleeding Study
INTERPRETATION: Following intravenous injection of autologous
red blood cells labeled with Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m, blood flow and dynamic
images of the abdomen for minutes were obtained. A left lateral
view of the pelvis was also obtained at 90 minutes.
Blood flow images show no evidence of radiotracer extravasation.

Dynamic blood pool images show no evidence of radiotracer
extravasation.
IMPRESSION: No evidence of GI bleeding.

[**6-6**] Colonoscopy:
Findings:
 Mucosa: Normal mucosa was noted in the sigmoid colon,
descending colon, transverse colon and ascending colon.
 Excavated Lesions Multiple diverticula were seen throughout the
colon.There was no active bleeding noted.
Impression: Diverticulosis of the colon
Normal mucosa in the sigmoid colon, descending colon, transverse
colon and ascending colon Otherwise normal colonoscopy to mid
ascending colon
Recommendations:
1. No active bleeding noted although pt could have bleed from
these diverticuli.
2. Follow serial Hct
3. If continues to bleed, need repeat bleeding scan/angio and
surgical consult.
Additional notes: 1. Procedure done with attending supervision.

[**2192-6-7**]: CXR INDICATION: Chest pain. Gastrointestinal bleed.
Cardiac silhouette is upper limits of normal in size. Vascular
pedicle has decreased in width and pulmonary vascularity appears
less engorged, consistent with overall improvement in volume
status of the patient. There are hazy areas of poorly defined
opacity in both upper lungs, right greater than left.
Differential diagnosis includes asymmetric edema versus focal
aspiration or infection. Small pleural effusions are unchanged.

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt. is an 83y/o F with a PMH of diverticulosis recently
discharged on [**2192-5-29**] s/p LGIB secondary to bleeding
diveriticulus admitted [**6-3**] with BRBPR.

# Diverticulosis - During prior hospitalization pt. was admitted
with a 2 week history of BRBPR at home. On [**5-21**] a diverticular
bleed found on first colonoscopy, epi injected, but patient with
continued LGIB which was seen in the distal sigmoid on tagged
RBC study [**5-24**]. The bleeding was not deemed amenable to angio
intervention. Repeat colonoscopy on [**5-25**] not able to identify
further source of bleeding. Pt discharged on [**5-29**] with a stable
hct. Since that time Pt. was doing well at home until she again
had an episode of BRBPR which she reported to fill the commode
the day prior to admission. She was admitted to MICU for further
evaluation. In MICU pt. was transfused 2U PRBCs. Surgery
consulted and felt no acute intervention was needed. GI
consulted, deferred colonoscopy at this time. UA positive and
pt. started on cipro. B-blocker initially held due to bleeding,
restarted [**6-4**] at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **]. She had no further epsiodes of
bleeding and was deemed stable for transfer to the floor. After
transfer pt. had one episode of BRBPR. GI bleeding study was
completed but no source of bleeding localized. IR consulted and
felt she was not amendable to angiography at this time. Pt. also
seen by surgery who felt no acute procedure was needed. Pt. was
found to have a HCT of 30.1 and she was transfused an additional
2U PRBC with appropriate increase in HCT. Pt. had repeat
colonoscopy on [**2192-6-6**] which demonstrated diverticulum but no
clear source of bleeding. She had no further of episodes of
bleeding during admission. Her diet was advanced to regular and
was tolerated well. She had a stable HCT through the remainder
of her hospital stay and was deemed stable for discharge home.
Pt. developed loose stools the day prior to admission. First C.
diff toxin negative. Pt. had not having large volume diarrhea.
Repeat C. diff toxin sent prior to discharge and pt. informed to
contact PCP to follow up results as outpatient.
.
# UTI - Pt. had a positive UA on presentation to the ED. Her
culture was mixed flora. She was treated with a three day course
of cipro. Pt. was also found to have hematuria which was likely
caused by trauma secondary to foley insertion. She was advised
to follow up for further evaluation with PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 907**] UA prior to
discharge was negative for blood.
.
# Chest Discomfort - Pt. has history of mild NSTEMI from demand
ischemia from previous hospitalization for GI bleed. Echo
obtained showed LVOF obstruction in
setting of hyperdynamic state, mild-moderate MR, but no wall ASA
avoided given GI
recommendations. Patient was initially held on metoprolol 25 [**Hospital1 **]
but was restarted at 12.5mg [**Hospital1 **] on [**6-4**]. Pt. had occassional
complaints of vague chest discomfort with no changes on ECG. On
[**6-7**] pt. experience increased chest discomfort which was
relieved by 2SL NTG and 2mg morphine. She had no changes on ECG,
no changes on CXR and negative CEX2. She was found to be
tachycardic and her metoprolol was increased to previous home
dose of 25mg [**Hospital1 **] and then titrated up to 75mg [**Hospital1 **] for improved
HR. Pt. will follow up with cardiology as outpatient [**2192-6-12**].
.
She had no further of episodes of bleeding with a stable HCT and
was deemed stable for discharge home. She will follow up with
cardiology and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] was advised to call her PCP or [**Hospital **]
clinic if she has a recurrence of BRBPR and to return to ED.

After discharge pt. was found to have C. Diff positive result.
The patient's PCP was notified of this result.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout
the procedure. No TEE related complications. The patient appears
to be in sinus rhythm. See Conclusions for post-bypass data The
post-bypass study was performed while the patient was receiving
vasoactive infusions (see Conclusions for listing of

Conclusions
PRE-BYPASS:
1. The left atrium is moderately dilated. No spontaneous echo
contrast is seen in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal
defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). [Intrinsic left
ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the
severity of valvular regurgitation.]
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.
4. There are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the aortic arch. There
are complex (>4mm) atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic
valve stenosis (area 1.2-1.9cm2). No aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is
severe mitral annular calcification. An eccentric,anterior
directed jet and a central jet are seen The effective
regurgitant orifice is >=0.40cm2 The mitral regurgitation vena
contracta is >=0.7cm. Severe (4+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
7. There is no pericardial effusion.

POST-BYPASS: For the post-bypass study, the patient was
receiving vasoactive infusions including phenylephrine.
1. A well-seated bioprosthetic valve is seen in the mitral
position with normal leaflet motion. No mitral regurgitation is
seen.
2. Left ventricular systolic function is normal. Right
ventricular systolic function is normal.
3. Aorta is intact post decannulation.
4. [**Location (un) 109**] is still mildly decreased with no gradient (Peak of 12 mm
of Hg).
4. Other findings are unchanged

CHEST (PA & LAT) - [**2179-5-30**]
As compared to the previous radiograph, there is unchanged
evidence
of mild bilateral hilar enlargement, potentially due to hilar
lymphadenopathy or enlarged pulmonary arteries.  Minimal
atelectasis at the left lung base and along the minor fissure.
No evidence of pneumonia, no pulmonary edema.  No pleural
effusions.


Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 939**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] Spine Surgery Service on
[**2179-5-24**] and taken to the Operating Room for L2-S1 interbody
fusion through an anterior approach.

# Lumbar spondylosis, scoliosis, and stenosis.
Please refer to the dictated operative note for further details.
The surgery was without complication and the patient was
transferred to the PACU in a stable condition. TEDs/pneumoboots
were used for postoperative DVT prophylaxis. Intravenous
antibiotics were given per standard protocol. Initial postop
pain was controlled with a PCA. On HD#2 she returned to the
operating room for a scheduled L2-S1 decompression with PSIF as
part of a staged 2-part procedure. Please refer to the dictated
operative note for further details. The second surgery was also
without complication and the patient was transferred to the
T/SICU in a stable condition. Postoperative HCT was 25 and she
was given 2 units PRBCs.  She was maintained on strict supine
bedrest for 48 hours given the small dural tear that was noted.
She was kept NPO until bowel function returned then diet was
advanced as tolerated. The patient was transitioned to oral pain
medication when tolerating PO diet. Foley was removed on POD#3
from the second procedure. She was fitted with a lumbar
warm-n-form brace for comfort. Physical therapy was consulted
for mobilization OOB to ambulate.

#) Delirium:
During her post-operative course, the patient was noted to be
confused and disoriented, prompting transfer to medicine for
further management of her delirium.  This was felt to be
possibly as secondary to narcotic medication and lingering
effects of anesthesia.  Infectious etiologies were ruled out and
the patient underwent an ABG which did not reveal evidence of
hypoventilation.  Her mental status improved significantly and
she was awake, alert, oriented x3 and long longer confused prior
to discharge.

#) Pain control:
The patient was intially maintained on a fentanyl PCA and this
was transitioned to oral pain medications with good control
prior to discharge.  She was followed by the chronic pain
service given her history of multiple medication allergies.  She
is to be discharged on tramadol, topiramate, and aceaminophen.

#) Anemia
Patient's baselined hematocrit was felt to be approximately 40
(from [**2179-4-24**]).  She required PRBC transfusions given
intraoperative blood [**Last Name (un) 940**].  Her hematocrit remained stable upon
discharge (28-29).

CHRONIC PROBLEMS

bilaterally.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted on [**2195-2-5**] to the
cardiothoracic service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70**] with the initial
diagnosis of coronary artery disease, unstable angina,
insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, hypertension, increased
cholesterol, AS, sleep apnea and obesity.  The patient had
coronary artery bypass grafting x 4 which included a left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary
artery, saphenous vein graft to the diagonal right coronary
artery and saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal
diagonal sequential.  The patient also had an aortic valve
replacement, a 21 mm mosaic porcine valve.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit.  The patient's
postoperative stay was complicated and total in-hospital days
was over 100.

The patient's initial hospital course was uncomplicated
within the intensive care unit.  On [**2-7**] the patient had a
bronchoscopy in which mucous plugs were removed from the
right upper lobe.  In early [**Month (only) 404**] the patient had
difficulty swallowing with possible aspiration.  Speech and
swallow evaluated the patient and noted that the patient had
severe upper esophageal achalasia.  Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 951**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 952**] saw the
patient and agreed the patient would need a dilatation of the
esophagus and placement of a feeding tube.

On [**2195-2-14**] the patient was brought to the operating room and
had a dilatation of the esophagus with [**Doctor Last Name 953**] dilators and
placement of a percutaneous feeding tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported to the
Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit in stable condition.

On [**2195-2-19**] renal saw the patient for increased BUN and
creatinine.  They initially thought the patient was prerenal
or could possibly have ATN.  Their initial recommendations
were to repeat the urinalysis, cultures, electrolytes,
discontinue Lasix and discontinue non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs.  The patient was still intubated at
that time and it was also decided that the patient would
benefit from a tracheostomy.

On [**2195-2-20**] a tracheostomy tube was placed for respiratory
failure, inability to wean from a vent.  A percutaneous
tracheostomy tube placement of a #8 Shiley tube was done by
Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 954**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 955**].  The surgery was uncomplicated
and the patient was transferred back to the CSRU in stable
condition.

On [**2195-2-21**] plastic surgery was asked to see the patient for
nonhealing saphenous vein graft donor sites where t.i.d.
dressing changes were then instituted and recommendations for
a V.A.C. to follow.

A her renal function did not return, the renal service
continued to follow closely and thought this could be a
mixture of acute tubular necrosis and prerenal disorder.  On
[**2195-2-16**] a right femoral vein dialysis catheter was placed
using the Seldinger technique for increased creatinine and
acute renal failure.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] the percutaneous tube subsequently
resulted in necrosis of the abdominal wall at the site of the
G-tube.  This was treated with nasogastric tube decompression
and tube feedings distal to the pylorus to allow the wound to
heal.  The gastrocutaneous fistula closed but the patient
developed extensive left leg cellulitis and induration.  The
patient was brought to the operating room on [**2195-3-17**] and had
a left abdominal wall and flank incision and drainage of the
deep soft tissue.  At that time the patient's chest also
showed signs of infection and drainage.  Initially wet-to-dry
dressings were started at the area and a V.A.C. dressing was
then placed to aid in healing.

Urology was also consulted at this time for hematuria which
responded to irrigation.  The hematuria resolved
spontaneously.  The renal failure continued throughout the
[**Hospital 228**] hospital stay with hemodialysis Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday.

Infectious disease was consulted for Klebsiella in the sputum
and Gram-negative rods for which the patient was placed on
cefuroxime.  They also evaluated for the chest wall abdominal
wounds.

At the end of [**Month (only) 404**] also the patient had a cystoscopy to
evaluate for the hematuria.  At that time the urology team
recommended repeat alum irrigant x 2 days.

Over the course of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay the
gastrocutaneous fistula closed and the nasogastric tube was
subsequently clamped and then removed.  During the
hospitalization the patient's antibiotic regimen was changed
several times to equate with the bacteria in the wound,
sputum and urine.

EP was also consulted for arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation
for which the recommended medical treatment and
heparinization.

In [**Month (only) 956**] the patient continued to have issues with
infectious disease.  The patient had a sternal wound
dehiscence with a wound infection and gastrocutaneous
fistula, the lower right extremity wound infection and
Klebsiella pneumoniae which was causing septic symptoms.
During this time the patient was continued on Nepro tube
feeds for nutrition and antibiotics were used in relation to
bacteria growing in the cultures.  At that time the patient
was still MRSA negative.  There was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the sputum and there was sparse growth of
Klebsiella in the fistula and sparse growth of B. fragilis
and beta lactamase positive in the right leg wound.

Over the hospital course the patient received multiple units
of packed red blood cells to normalize her hematocrit.

Urology concluded that the patient suffered from hemorrhagic
cystitis and on the 15th cleared the patient as doing well.
They decided that the patient was well enough urologically
that she would need no other treatment and that she could
follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 770**] after discharge.

During the hospital stay the patient had multiple central
lines placed for access.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] was consulted in mid
[**Month (only) 956**] for evaluation of nutrition and assistance with tube
feedings.

At the end of [**Month (only) 956**] the patient suffered from multiple
wound infections, failure to thrive and vent dependency.  The
patient also continued on hemodialysis for the acute renal
failure.  During [**Month (only) 958**] the patient continued to improve in a
waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] fashion.  The patient's antibiotics were
slowly weaned off.  The patient continued on Nepro at 40 cc
an hour.

In the middle of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient was evaluated by GI for
intermittent bleeding.  The patient most likely had gastritis
or esophagitis per GI and they recommended endoscopic
evaluation.

This is an addendum to the discharge summary for the days
[**2-5**] to [**5-28**].

During the month of [**Month (only) 958**] the patient progressed with
physical therapy and treatments of her infections with
antibiotics and good nutrition.  At the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
patient had a IJ Perm-A-Cath placed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transported
back to the CSRU in stable condition.  During this time the
patient was fed using a post pyloric tube while keeping the
nasogastric tube to suction to allow closure of
enterocutaneous fistula.  Toward the end of [**Month (only) 958**] the
nasogastric tube was removed.  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 957**] on the [**4-18**] placed a feeding jejunostomy tube.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well and was transported back to the
CSRU in stable condition.  Following surgery the patient was
restarted on the tube feeds Nepro 40 cc with 110 grams of
ProMod q.d.  The patient continued to progress during her
hospital stay and it was decided that the patient would be
able to be discharged to rehabilitation services for further
physical therapy.

On the [**4-26**] it was decided that the patient will be
able to be transferred to rehabilitation services.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 75-year-old female
patient who had a very prolonged previous hospitalization at
the [**Hospital1 69**] and was ultimately
discharged on [**2195-5-28**].  During her hospitalization,
she underwent coronary artery bypass graft x4 with an aortic
valve replacement.  Her postoperative course was complicated
by aspiration, wound infection of her sternal wound as well
as of her saphenectomy, gastrostomy tube placement, followed
by necrosis of the abdominal wall as well as acute renal
failure.  Please see discharge summary from that
hospitalization for details of her postoperative course after
her cardiac surgery.

The patient was readmitted to the hospital on [**2195-6-6**]
due to fevers to 103 at the rehabilitation facility despite
being on intravenous antibiotics.  In the Emergency
Department, the patient was noted to have a fair amount of
purulent drainage in the open sternal wound.  The patient was
admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit at that time.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass
graft as previously noted with an aortic valve replacement
for aortic stenosis.
2. End-stage renal disease.  The patient is hemodialysis
dependent.
3. Hypertension.
4. Insulin dependent-diabetes mellitus.
5. Sleep apnea.
6. Vertigo.
7. Osteoarthritis.
8. Skin cancer in the past.
9. Abdominal hernia repair.
10. Uterine cancer status post total abdominal hysterectomy.
11. Obesity.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:
1. Tobramycin.
2. Vancomycin.
3. Reglan.
4. Protonix.
5. Amiodarone.
6. Zoloft.
7. Compazine.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  The
patient was awake and responsive, following commands
appropriately.  She was on a ventilator via tracheostomy.
HEENT was unremarkable.  Her lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Patient was tachycardic with a regular, rate,
and rhythm.  Her abdomen was soft, obese, nontender, and
nondistended.

LABORATORY VALUES UPON ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL:  White
blood cell count of 10,000, hematocrit of 32, platelet count
of 201.  Sodium of 148, potassium 3.3, chloride 110, CO2 21,
BUN 42, creatinine 3.7, glucose of 277.

Patient initially had an echocardiogram which revealed a left
ventricular ejection fraction of 60% and moderate tricuspid
regurgitation.

Chest x-ray on admission to the hospital revealed a small
left pleural effusion, and questionable congestive heart
failure pattern.

It was noted that the patient's Vancomycin and tobramycin
levels were quite low upon admission to the hospital, and she
was restarted on both of those medications.

On [**6-7**], hospital day two, the patient underwent a
Plastic Surgery consultation due to persistent sternal wound
infection, which had previously been healing now showing
signs of infection.  Patient was also noted to have
Clostridium difficile colitis, for which she had been placed
on intravenous Flagyl.

The patient was ultimately taken to the operating room on
[**2195-6-9**] after transesophageal echocardiogram the
previous day ruled out endocarditis.  In the operating room
the patient underwent a limited sternal wound debridement and
drainage of some fluids at the inferior portion of her wound.

Postoperatively, the patient returned to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit, where she has had problems with
intermittent hypotension requiring IV Neo-Synephrine drip.
Patient continued on tube feeds via her jejunostomy tube
which was previously placed during her previous admission,
which she had been tolerating well.  She was still on the
ventilator on varying levels of pressure support in the CPAP
mode which she had tolerated well on 50% FIO2.

Patient received a few units of packed red blood cells over
the course of the next few days due to drifting hematocrit.
Patient's sternal wound had remained clean, and ultimately a
VAC dressing was placed in the sternal wound area on [**2195-6-18**].  The patient was maintained on 3x a week hemodialysis
treatments on Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and has been
tolerating those treatments well.  Patient's pressure support
was ultimately weaned from 12 to 5, and she has remained on
pressure support of 5 for the past few days with an FIO2 of
50% and a PEEP of 5 as well, and has remained stable on those
ventilator settings.

The patient has had short bouts of trache mask trials, but
does get tachypneic after approximately 30 minutes.  Patient
also required bedside repositioning of her jejunostomy tube
which was done in the Intensive Care Unit successful with no
sequelae from that patient.  The patient has remained with
stable hemodynamic parameters.  Has been tolerating her tube
feeds, has remained on minimal ventilator supports, and she
is ready to be transferred to rehabilitation facility to
progress with Physical [**Hospital 966**] rehabilitation, and ultimate
weaning from a ventilator.

The patient's condition day on [**2195-6-19**] is as follows:
temperature is 99.0, heart rate is 88 in normal sinus rhythm,
respiratory rate varies from 18-24.  Her blood pressure is
114/46.  On the ventilator, the patient is in a CPAP mode
with 5 of PEEP, 5 of pressure support, and 50% of O2 with a
most recent blood gas being 7.41, 41, 73, 27.  Other
laboratory values from today, [**6-19**] are as follows:  White
blood cell count 5.6, hematocrit of 35.8, platelet count of
206.  PT 13.9, INR 1.3, PTT 29.9, sodium 132, potassium 5.3,
chloride 99, CO2 24, BUN 64, creatinine 3.6, glucose 124.

Patient's most recent chest x-ray was on [**2195-6-8**] which
showed a chronic left pleural effusion.

Most recent cultures include a sputum culture from [**6-8**]
which revealed MRSA, Pseudomonas, as well as Serratia.
Patient is previously cultured MRSA from both her leg wound
and her sternal wound.  Stool on [**6-10**] is positive for
Clostridium difficile.  Urine on [**6-12**] is positive for
proteus and enterococcus, and her sternal wound swab on [**6-9**] had rare growth of diphtheroids.

Physical examination today:  The patient is awake, alert, and
responsive.  She has coarse breath sounds bilaterally.  Her
chest wound is clean with a VAC dressing in place.  Her
abdomen is soft, obese, and nontender.  Her extremities are
with 2+ edema bilaterally.

sinus, likely secondary to hypoxia, hyperkalemia.

1) CARDIAC - Status post arrest.  Patient with history of
arrest.  The patient was ruled out by enzymes.  The arrest
was likely a combination of hypoxia and mucous plugging, as
well as metabolic with possible hyperkalemia and
hypercalcemia.  The patient has a history of a normal echo.
The patient's rhythm was in sinus.  The patient was continued
on 200 mg po qd.  The patient placed on telemetry and
monitored in the MICU.  Monitored electrolytes and in's and
out's.  The patient remained stable throughout her

Date of Birth:   [**2120-5-13**]     Sex:  F

Service:  MICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Sepsis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 75 year old
female with an extremely complicated past medical history
including coronary artery bypass graft times four, atrial
ventricular valve replacement in [**1-12**], and a precipitously
difficult postoperative course.  The patient has never been
weaned from her ventilator and has had multiple ventilator
associated pneumonias, particularly most recently with
pseudomonas Serratia and Klebsiella.  The patient has end
stage renal disease and history of gastrointestinal bleed
secondary to gastritis and esophagitis.

Most recently, the patient was discharged from this hospital
to rehabilitation in early [**Month (only) 547**] only to come back with
fevers and ultimately grew out Methicillin resistant
Staphylococcus aureus wound infection requiring debridement
on [**2195-5-28**].  The patient returned to rehabilitation
[**2195-6-22**], where she sustained a pulmonary embolus arrest,
received Epinephrine and electrical conversion.  The patient
was noted to have decreased responsiveness post code
attributed to anoxic brain injury per neurology.  She was
transferred back to [**Hospital **] Rehabilitation where she
underwent vigorous physical therapy.

On [**2195-8-1**], per family she had a fever of 103 with culture
peripherally and from her dialysis catheter.  Both grew out
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  The patient was
started on a course of Vancomycin with only low grade
temperature.  She became lethargic on [**2195-8-9**], and was
unable to tolerate hemodialysis due to hypotension, systolic
blood pressure in the 70s.  The patient briefly improved
postdialysis on [**2195-8-10**], as did her mental status, but then
became increasingly lethargic with heart beats in the 130s,
blood pressure 80 over palpable, and was transferred over to
[**Hospital1 69**] for further management.

On arrival, the patient was noted to be extremely febrile,
hypotensive, tachypneic.  The patient received an A line and
right internal jugular central line for monitoring and fluid
resuscitation.  The patient's course was complicated by her
poor toleration of hemodialysis secondary to hypotension and
was started on pressors of Levophed and ultimately required
an addition of vasopressor.  The patient was becoming
increasingly somnolent and had not defervesced at this time
despite the addition of multiple antibiotic therapy, Flagyl,
Ceftriaxone, Vancomycin, and Tobramycin.

CT of the abdomen and chest showed no frank abscess or fluid
collection.  Flagyl was ultimately discontinued as decreased
probability of anaerobic infection.  Cultures at outside
hospital showed multidrug resistant organisms including
Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.  Transesophageal
echocardiogram was obtained to rule out endocarditis and it
was negative showing ejection fraction of 55%.  Left Hickman
catheter with [**Hospital1 **] as probable source of infection.
Foley was placed at this time.  The patient was anuric yet
10cc of purulent material was noted.  The patient was now
growing gram positive cocci in pairs and clusters from two
different sites, the Hickman and/or previous PICC line.  She
was increasing her pressor requirement and was hypotensive
despite two liters of fluid.

She was started on Dopamine in addition to her Levophed and
vasopressors. Throughout the day, the patient's systolic
blood pressure decreased to the 80/30.  By [**2195-8-14**], she was
back on EC vent control.  The patient was noted at 3:43 a.m.
on [**2195-8-15**], to have an episode of asystole.  The family was
at bedside as well throughout the night.  The pupils were
noted to be fixed and dilated and unresponsive.  Ventilation
was discontinued and spontaneous respirations were not
observed.  The patient was declared dead at 3:43 a.m. The
family declined autopsy.

Brief Hospital Course:
After initial presentation to the ED, patient was admitted to
the surgical intensive care unit under the direct care of Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. In the ED, patient became hypotensive requiring liters
of IVF, oxygen 4LNC administered, started on Levophed 0.1 mg,
central line was place, Levofloxacin and Flagyl intravenously
were started for leukocytosis. Blood, urine and stool cultures/c
Diff sent. CT scan was obtained and revealed; severe colonic
wall thickening involving ascending, transverse, and descending
colon, less pronounced sigmoid and rectum. The pancolitis
picture was suggestive of pseudomembranous colitis.
.
ICU Course HD2-HD4: HD2, patient remained on Levophed and
insulin drips, receiving fluid resuscitation with lactated
ringers, leukocytosis increasing from 12 to 25, bandemia,
antibiotic coverage was levofloxacin and Flagyl. Abdomen was
more distended, no tenderness, adequate urine output and organ
perfusion, KUB revealed edematous colon but no dilation,
multiple episodes of liquid green stool, specimen for C. Diff
was positive. HD3, WBC trending down, Levophed slowly weaned
off, abdomen less distended, minimally tender in lower
quadrants. HD4, chest x-ray revealed fluid overload with mild
increase in the cardiac silhouette and bilateral pleural
effusions. Patient received Lasix 10mg IV with good effect.
Levoflaxacin was d/c and vancomycin po was started. Patient was
hemodynamically stable and transferred to CC6 (floor).
.
HD5, patient was an episode of dropping oxygen saturation 84-88%
on 4Liters nasal cannula, lungs sounds positive for crackles at
the bases, patient received Lasix 20mg IV once with good effect.
WBC continued to trend down. She received substantial
electrolyte repletion of potassium, magnesium and neutrophos.
Patient started on a clear diabetic liquid diet and advanced to
regular diet. She was started on home dose of Lantus. Patient
continued to have multiple diarrhea stools. Central line was
d/c. Foley catheter was d/c and patient was voiding without
difficulty. Infectious disease, [**Hospital **] clinic and Physical
Therapy were consulted.
.
Infectious Disease was consulted on HD#5; patient presenting
with C. Diff infection in the absence of antibiotic use,
exposure or known contact at health care facility, and no recent
invasive procedures. Patient was seen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 976**] (Fellow)
and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 977**] (Attending), assessed that since patient
has a history of an autoimmune disorder, may not be completely
""normal"" host. The differential for pancolitis would also
include CMV colitis, ischemic colitis (less likely). They
recommended obtaining a CMV viral load, repeat iron studies
given microcytic anemia, plan to check C. Diff toxin prior to
starting vancomycin taper. continue with Vancomycin by mouth 250
mg every 6 hours times 14 days, then 250 mg [**Hospital1 **] x 7 days, then
250 mg daily x 7 days, then off. They also instructed patient on
hygiene techniques for her home.
.
Physical therapy consult concluded that patient may require
rehabiliation upon discharge if mobility does not improve.
Patient remains functioning below baseline level and
deconditioned from hospitalization. It was recommended that
patient would benefit from increase mobility and breathing
exercises.
.
[**Hospital **] Clinic was consulted on HD7 for management of IDDM.
Patient is known to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 978**] @ [**Hospital **] Clinic. They
recommended to increase Lantus to 12 units daily, increase
pre-meal sliding-scale, switch from regular insulin to humalog,

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
none


History of Present Illness:
82 year old male with past medical history of coronary artery
disease, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, BPH, chronic
kidney disease and gout who presents with intermittent confusion
and high fevers. The patient is [**First Name3 (LF) 595**] speaking only, generally
sleepy but family (son) recounts that the patient had difficulty
voiding 6/1-2/[**2150**]. At the time, he endorsed urinating
frequently but small amounts each time (?frequency, urgency)He
presented to the [**Hospital1 18**] and was found on urinalysis to have a
UTI. He did not have any fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, flank
pain at the time. He was discharged on Macrobid 100mg twice
daily X 7 days. The patient has been taking the medication
reliably but urine culture sensitivities/speciation today
demonstrated Enterobacter aerogenes sensitive to a number of
antibiotics, but resistant to macrobid. The patient's wife was
[**Name (NI) 653**] by the [**Name (NI) **] QA via [**Name (NI) 595**] interpreter and Cipro 250mg
tablets daily X 7 days was prescribed.
.
In the interim, the patient's son has been calling to check in
on him and found him progressively lethargic, dizzy and
intermittently unable to urinate. Today he slept throughout the
day and had some urinary frequency/urgency in the morning that
resolved this afternoon. He also developed high fevers
(temperature not taken) with rigors/shakes. He was noted to have
elevated blood sugars and lower blood pressures than normal. He
usually runs SBP160-180s, per his son, without antihypertensives
and SBP110-120s with them. This morning, he took all his
medications and subsequently, his blood pressures have been in
the SBP90s. The patient has taken in very little PO food/liquids
since [**2151-5-21**]. He did take one tablet of the Cipro this
afternoon and stated he felt somewhat better.
.
In the ED, initial VS: T100.8, HR96, BP111/46, RR20, O2 sat 97%
on RA. He was given acetaminophen 650mg PR and ciprofloacin
400mg IV X1. His labs were notable for hyponatremia (132), Cr
1.4 (close to prior baseline), leukocytosis to 11.9 with left
shift (no bands). His lactate was 1.6. He was also given IVF and
did become less lethargic, more interactive with family. He did
not urinate down in the ED to provide a repeat sample.
.
Upon transfer to the medical floor, vitals were T: 98.1 P: 88
BP: 103/45 RR: 25 SaO2: 95% on 2L NC (does not use oxygen at

IMAGING:
[**2151-5-25**] NCHCT:  There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage, edema,
mass effect, or large acute territorial infarction.  The
[**Doctor Last Name 352**]-white matter differentiation is well preserved. There is
mild age-related brain parenchymal atrophy with secondary mild
dilatation of the ventricles.

The paranasal sinuses and mastoids are clear.  There are no
suspicious lytic or sclerotic bony lesions.

IMPRESSION:  No acute intracranial abnormality.

NOTE ADDED IN ATTENDING REVIEW: There is significantly
disproportionate
lateral more than 3rd ventriculomegaly, compared to the degree
of sulcal
prominence; while this may simply represent preferential central
atrophy,
underlying communicating hydrocephalus is an additional
consideration, and
should be correlated clinically.
[**2151-5-25**] CXR:  There is a right infrahilar and a right lung apex
opacity, possibly representing multifocal PNA. The
cardiomediastinal silhouette and hila are normal.  There is no
pleural effusion and no pneumothorax.
[**2151-5-25**] EKG:  Atrial fibrillation. Left axis deviation. Right
bundle-branch block. Consider inferior myocardial infarction.
Since the previous tracing
of [**2145-5-31**], atrial fibrillation is new, axis is now more
leftward, and
QRS width is wider. Clinical correlation is suggested.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
90 0 172 410/462 0 -86 23
[**2151-5-26**] CXR:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient
has unchanged focal parenchymal opacities in the right upper and
right lower lobe.  In addition, however, there is an increase in
size of the cardiac silhouette, increase in diameter of the
pulmonary vessels and increase of the interstitial markings.
Altogether, these findings suggest interval appearance of
pulmonary edema.
[**2151-5-26**] EKG:   Atrial fibrillation with a modestly controlled
ventricular response. Left axis deviation. Right bundle-branch
block with left anterior fascicular block.  There are tiny R
waves in the inferior leads consistent with possible myocardial
infarction. Compared to tracing #1 atrial fibrillation has
replaced by atrial tachycardia.
Rate PR QRS QT/QTc P QRS T
91 0 152 368/422 0 -77 56
[**2151-5-27**] CXR:  Right upper lobe consolidation is more conspicuous
than before.  Right perihilar and lower lobe opacities have
improved.  Cardiomegaly and widened mediastinum are unchanged.
Right pleural effusion is stable.  There is improved pulmonary
edema. There are no new lung abnormalities.
[**2151-5-28**] ECHO:  The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild
symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is mildly depressed (LVEF= 45 %) secondary to
hypokinesis of the inferior, posterior, and lateral walls. The
right ventricular free wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. with borderline normal free
wall function. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic
valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. There is a minimally
increased gradient consistent with minimal aortic valve
stenosis. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. No vegetations seen
[**2151-5-29**] EKG:  Sinus rhythm. Prolonged P-R interval. Right
bundle-branch block with left anterior fascicular block.
Compared to the previous tracing of [**2151-5-27**], the rhythm has
changed.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P:  89 yo w/ afib, LBBB and recurrent UTIs admitted with
urospesis requiring MICU transfer, discharged home with a 2 week
course of ciprofloxacin and home physical therapy.
.
ENTEROBACTER BACTERMIA AND SEPSIS:  Patient initially was seen
in the emergency department approximatley 1 week prior to
admission with a UTI, treated with macrobid.  The patient was
subsquently [**Telephone/Fax (3) 653**] by the Emergency Department after culture
results returned with a macrobid resistant enterobacter species
and perscribed ciprofloxacin.  Approximately 2 days after
starting ciprofloxacin, though it is unclear how many doses the
patient took, he developed lethargy, confusion and fevers at
home.  He was admitted to the medical service where he quickly
triggered for hypotension and was not responsive to 4 L of fluid
boluses.  He was broadened to Vanc/Cefepime and subsequently
developed pulmonary edema in the setting of volume reusitation
and was transfered to the MICU without requiring intubation.
Blood cultures returned GNRs in [**3-24**] bottles later speciated as a
pan-sensitive enterobacter similar to what was seen in the
urine.  CXR showed a possible multifocal pneumonia as well.
Infectious diseases was consulted and recommended treatment with
ciprofloxacin for a 2 week course despite the patient's
prolonged QTc from a prior intrafasicular block.  No inpatient
urologic evaluation was felt indciated though his recurrent
urinary tract infections and prior prostate operations did
warrant further outpatient evaluation.  QTc at discharge was 444
ms.
.
# TROPONINEMIA:  Patient was noted to have an elevated troponin
with a normal CK-MB fraction in the setting of septic shock and
volume resusitation.  Given his coronary history and underlying
LBBB perventing adequate evaluation of ischemic changes the
patient underwent ECHO which showed a posterior/inferior
hypokenesis.  Cardiololgy was consulted and felt this be related
to demand and not an acute coronary process.  Patient was
continued on home meds and scheduled for outpatient cardiology
follow up.
.
# HTN: Patient's antihypertensives were initially held in the
setting of sepsis.  His antihypertensives were gradually
restarted but the patient was symptomatically hypotensive on his
home regimen while working with phsyical therapy.  His
amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide were therefore held and
patient was able to maintain pressures in the 120s on valsartan
320 mg, lasix 40 and metoprolol XL 50 mg daily.
.
# Hyperlipidemia: Stable continued on home statin.
.
# Atrial fibrillation: Stable, was intermittently in sinus
rhythm through out his stay.  Discharged on home metoprolol and
pradaxa.
.
# Diabetes mellitus, type 2: Stable, home oral hypoglycemics
were held in house in the setting of sepsis and patient
maintained on an insulin sliding scale.
.
# Benigm prostatic hypertrophy: s/p TURP and generally stable
though difficulty voiding and prior prostate instrumentation
raises the risk for recurrent UTIs.  Patient was scheduled for
outpatient urology follow up with his primary urologist Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 986**].
.
# Gout: Stable, no signs or symptoms of a flare continued home
allopurinol

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Dyspnea on exertion.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 65-year-old man
recently evaluated for worsening dyspnea on exertion.  The
patient was first evaluated for dyspnea on exertion back in
[**2183-9-28**].  At that point, he was found to have mild
left coronary artery disease as well as a totally occluded
right coronary artery with good collaterals.  He was also
noted to have a moderate mitral regurgitation.  He was
managed medically for this condition.

During the course of the year [**2184**], the patient noted
progressive decrease in his activity tolerance.  After work
up, it was determined that the patient was in need of repair
of his mitral valve as well as coronary artery bypass
grafting.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Myocardial infarction.
2.  Coronary artery disease.
3.  Possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
4.  Depression.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Hyperlipidemia.
7.  Valve disease.
8.  Remote pleurisy.
9.  Arthritis.
10. Possible prior CVA.
11. Recovered alcoholic (has not drank in 16 years).

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Umbilical hernia repair.
2.  Cataract surgery.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:
1.  Vistaril.
2.  Lipitor.
3.  Multivitamins.
4.  Aspirin.
5.  Escitalopram.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to the Medical Center
on [**2185-10-25**] and taken to surgery for coronary artery bypass
graft and mitral valve repair.  Surgery was performed without
complications and patient thereafter was transferred to the
CSRU.  Later on the day of surgery, the patient received two
units of packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of 21.2.

Patient required pacing through postoperative day #1 and #2
to maintain an adequate heart rate.  He was successfully
extubated on postoperative day #1, even though he continued
to be wheezy with significant productive cough during his
entire stay in the CSRU.

The patient as stable enough for transfer to the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Floor late on postoperative day #2.
Late on postoperative day #5, the patient went into atrial
fibrillation.  His heart rate was eventually successfully
controlled with Metoprolol and Amiodarone.  The patient had
periods of persistent tachycardia during postoperative day
#6.  Decision was made to initiate anticoagulation with
heparin as well as Coumadin.  The patient remained stable and
without complaints during postoperative day #7.

On postoperative day #8, the patient was deemed stable for
discharge to home.  The decision was made to discontinue the
patient's Amiodarone prior to discharge given decrease in his
heart rate to the 50s.  He remained in sinus rhythm.

Following discharge, it was planned the patient would receive
a visit from a visiting nurse two days following discharge
for an INR check.  The results of the INR check was to be
faxed to the patient's cardiologist.  The patient was to call
his cardiologist on discharge day #2 for instructions on
further Coumadin doses.  The patient was to take 10 more days
of Lasix following discharge since he was still significantly
above his admission weight.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
2.  Escitalopram 10 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Atorvastatin 200 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Percocet.
5.  Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
6.  Potassium Chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d.
7.  Lasix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.
8.  Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.d. times two days.

FO[**Last Name (STitle) 996**]P:
1.  Patient is to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in clinic
four weeks following discharge.
2.  Patient was to contact his cardiologist's office two days
following discharge for further guidance on his Coumadin
dosing as well as to schedule a follow up appointment.
3.  The patient was to contact his primary care physician's
office for a follow up appointment in approximately three
weeks.

History of Present Illness:
The pt is a 59 year-old right-handed with progressively
worsening stiffness, weakness, and dysarthria since [**2183**] who is
sent in from her rehab for generalized weakness , decline and
difficulty eating. The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] in the
movement disorders division who notes an extensive negative
workup in his most recent assessment of [**2186-1-10**] (see below).
Per
the record the stiffness started after a fall on ICE in [**2183**].
She
was admitted 7/21-26/07 for left leg dystonia. Possible
etiologies considered at that time included hereditary spastic
paraparesis, Parkinsons, and multiple systems atrophy. Little
evidence could be found for any of these disorders.


An new EMG today demonstrated a generalized, moderately severe,
chronic and ongoing disorder of motor neurons or their axons.


The patient has been on tizanidine, flexeril, baclofen, sinemet,
and artane - none with particularly significant effect.



Past Medical History:
depression,
rotator cuff injury,
osteopenia,

appendectomy
Per Dr.[**Name (NI) 1033**] [**2186-1-10**] note:
""Extensive prior evaluations were summarized in my note from [**6-11**], [**2185**], including multiple brain and spine imaging studies
that
have failed to yield an explanation for her symptoms. She also
was admitted. She has had negative HTLV 1 and 2 testing,
negatively glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, negative
spinal fluid analyses including absence of oligoclonal bands,
normal ceruloplasmin, negative RPR, negative Lyme serology,
negative [**Doctor First Name **], rheumatoid factor, and HIV test. EMG also was
reported to be normal in 08/[**2185**]. She was admitted in [**2185-7-24**]

with increased mobility difficulties. The additional evaluation

did not reveal a clear etiology. They initiated a trial of
tizanidine, and this may have helped somewhat. They also reduced

her Flexeril dose.""

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 1034**] is a 59-year-old woman who was admitted for
further evaluation of her chronic progressive movement disorder.
Based on her exam, which with her progression by the time of
this admission showed mixed upper and lower motor neuron signs,
and based on her EMG on the day of admission showing motor
neuron disease, she was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS).

1. ALS. She was set up to follow up in the [**Hospital **] clinic. After a
pulmonology consult, it was seen that she did well with her
respiratory status when sitting upright during the day, but has
paradoxical breathing at night. She was transferred for one
night to the ICU for BiPAP titration, and she should now use
this at night.

2. Dysphagia. She passed a swallow eval, but was given a PEG for
supplemental nutrition and with the expectation that her
dysphagia will progress. She can take some nutrition by mouth
and is getting tube feeds as in the discharge instructions.
*** The T-fastener skin sutures (green-colored sutures) can be
cut and released in [**8-3**] days (between [**2-25**] and [**2-28**]). ***

3. Spasticity. She was started on tizanidine (Zanaflex) and
Flexeril for painful spasticity, and was given a Lidoderm patch
for the pain. This did improve her, though she remains highly
spastic.

4. Anxiety. Psychiatry was consulted for her anxiety and
recommended Ativan as ordered (with caution for her respiratory
status) and Buspar, in addition to continuing her Lexapro.

5. CODE STATUS: After length discussions with her, she decided
to be a DNR/DNI.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is an 84-year-old male
referred to Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for evaluation of surgical
options for severe aortic stenosis and coronary artery
disease.

The patient experienced a near-syncopal episode in [**2124-1-8**]; for which she was evaluated at [**Hospital 1048**] [**Hospital 1049**] Hospital.
As part of his workup, the patient received a cardiac
catheterization which subsequently demonstrated severe aortic
stenosis with an aortic valve area of 0.78 cm2 and mild grade
[**12-11**] aortic insufficiency.  In addition, the patient
demonstrated 3-vessel disease of the right coronary artery,
left anterior descending artery, and circumflex with diffuse
68% stenosis of each.

Th[**Last Name (STitle) 1050**] was subsequently evaluated by Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] and
recommended for elective coronary artery bypass graft and
aortic valve repair to take place on [**2124-4-24**].

1.  Aspirin.
2.  Primidone.
3.  Vioxx.
4.  Tagamet.
5.  Terazosin.
6.  Lisinopril.
7.  Oxybutynin.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired.  He is married and
lives with his wife in [**Name (NI) 1051**], [**Name (NI) 108**].  The patient has
a past history of smoking but has been abstinent for many
years.  The patient denies the use of alcohol or recreational
drugs.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   On [**2124-4-24**] the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft using a saphenous vein graft and
aorta to the right posterior descending artery, as well as an
aortic valve repair using a 23-mm CE tissue valve.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well with a total bypass time
of 139 minutes and a cross-clamp time of 125 minutes.

The patient's pericardium was left open.  Lines placed
included an arterial line and a Swan-Ganz catheter.  Both
ventricular and atrial wires were placed.  Two mediastinal
tubes were placed.  The patient was subsequently transferred
intubated to the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit for
further observation and management.

On transfer, the patient had a mean arterial pressure of 62,
a central venous pressure of 9, a PAD of 14, and [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1052**] of 19.
The patient was noted to be in a normal sinus rhythm at a
rate of 90 beats per minute.  Active drips on transfer
included propofol.

In the Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was
initially noted to be agitated and hypertensive; requiring
treatment with a nitroglycerin drip and Haldol for sedation.

On postoperative day two, the patient was successfully weaned
and extubated without complications.  Following extubation,
the patient was noted to be confused with variable compliance
with following commands and variable orientation.  This
confusion continued for the duration of his admission with
gradual resolution to a level consistent with the patient's
baseline level of moderate dementia.

The patient continued to progress well clinically in the
Cardiothoracic Surgery Recovery Unit with an uneventful
transition to a full regular diet and adequate transition to
pain control via oral pain medications.

Following successful removal of his chest tubes and pacer
wires on postoperative day four, the patient was cleared for
transfer to the floor and was subsequently admitted to the
Cardiothoracic Service under the direction of Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**].

On the floor, the patient continued to progress well
clinically to the time of his discharge.  The patient was
restarted on his home medications with a notable improvement
in his mental status and was also placed on evening
Risperidone 0.5 mg with a notable decrease in his nighttime
agitation.

On the evening of postoperative day six, the patient
sustained a minor fall while agitated; resulting in a small
abrasion to his right forearm without other associated
injuries.  At no time did the patient sustain any head trauma
or loss of consciousness.

On postoperative day seven, the patient's Foley catheter was
removed without complications.  He was subsequently noted to
be independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for
the duration of his stay.

The patient was also evaluated by Physical Therapy who
declared the patient a suitable candidate for placement in a
rehabilitation facility following resolution of his acute
medical issues.  Thereafter, the patient was screened by a
rehabilitation facility and subsequently cleared for
discharge to an extended care facility on postoperative day
nine ([**2124-5-3**]) with instructions for followup.

Brief Hospital Course:
Impression: 45 yo man with h/o HIV (CD4=227) and multiple past
pneumonias presents with acute LUL pneumococcal pneumonia ans
sepsis.

PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA AND SEPSIS
The patient presented with a cough productive of brown sputum,
pleuritic left sided chest pain, and a large left upper lobe
infiltrate on his CXR.  In the emergency department he became
tachypnic, hypoxic and hypotensive, with pressures that were not
responsive to fluid boluses.  He was intubated, started on
pressors and broad spectrum antibiotics, and admitted to the
MICU.  His admission blood cultures showed high grade bacteremia
with pneumococcus (3/4 bottles positive).  He underwent a
broncheoalveolar lavage, from which cultures have remained
negative.  Once the blood culture data returned his coverage was
initially narrowed to levaquin, but he had persistent low grade
fevers and a worsening of his leukocytosis, so was again started
on broader coverage with cefepime and vancomycin for a question
of ventillator associated pneumonia.  He was successfully
extubated on [**2143-3-15**] and was transferred to the floor the
following day.

On the floor his coverage was again narrowed, but again he
seemed to decompensate with low grade temps and worsening
leukocytosis, so cefepime and vancomycin were restarted.  Serial
CXRs done on [**3-15**] and [**3-18**] showed improvement in the LUL opacity
but development of a new LLL opacity and left sided pleural
effusion.  On [**3-20**], a chest CT was done which revealed a
significant left pleural effusion with LLL collapse.  The MET
service was called in for a thoracentesis. 600cc was removed
from the left lung, and sent for testing, which revealed an
exudative effusion without malignant cells.  Cultures were
negative.  An induced sputum was also done (as the patient was
not clearing his secretions) and grew sparce OP flora. Repeat CT
scan one week later showed marked resolution of LLL effusion. He
had evidence of progressing pneumonia, with new right sided tree
and [**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities. However clinically he appeared to be
improving, with decreased oxygen requirement and no further
fevers. Interventional pulmonary and pulmonary were consulted
for re-evaluation, but neither bronchosopy or re-tapping of left
sided pleural effusion were felt to be indicated. Given the
known suseptibility of his pneumococcus he was started again on
IV levofloxacin 500mg daily and cefepime and vancomycin were
discontinued. He remained afebrile on 3 days of IV therapy and
was therefore switched to PO regimen. His primary infectious
disease physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] was contact[**Name (NI) **] to discuss his case.
It was felt that he should stay on Levofloxacin indefinitely
until a repeat CT scan may be performed as an outpatient to
document clearance of his infection. At that point he may need
chronic suppressive therapy, possibly with penicillin. He will
follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] on [**4-17**] and with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name (STitle) 1058**]
on [**5-3**].

CHEST PAIN
On admission the patient complained of pleuritic left-sided
chest pain.  EKG did not show changes consistent with ACS, and
one set of cardiac enzymes was negative.  Once extubated and
transferred to the floor, he comtinued to have significant
discomfort.  His pain was pleuritic but was also worse with
palpation.  An EKG showed isolated TWI in V2 and another set of
cardiac enzymes was flat.  CXR at that time showed only
improving LUL opacity.  The pain was attributed to left-sided
pleural inflammation secondary to his known infection.  He was
started on narcotic pain medications, which somewhat controlled
the pain.  The pain service was also consulted to help the
primary team manage the complicated pain issues in this patient.
They suggested adding methadone and a lidoderm patch, with
ibuprofen if tolerated, with plan to taper off of oxycontin. The
main concern over opiate analgesics was his prior history of
substance abuse. However after discussion with the team, it was
felt that he had a legitimate reason for pleuritic pain, so he
was kept on both oxycontin and methadone for optimal pain
control, in addition to lidoderm patch. This regimen led to very
good pain control, with patient reporting 0/10 pain. Therefore
the plan is to taper off methadone slowly as pain continues to
resolve concurrently with his pneumonia. At the time of
discharge he is on 20mg oxycodone SR [**Hospital1 **] and 7.5 mg Methadone
TID. We will taper him down to 5mg [**Hospital1 **] Methadone, and this may
be tapered off over the next 1-2 weeks as his symptoms continue
to improve. He may be maintained on the oxycodone as needed for
long-term pain control. At the time of discharge he was also
re-started on Neurontin for his chronic neuropathic leg pain.

HYPOTENSION
As above, the patient became hypotensive in the ED.  This was
thought to be likely [**1-9**] septic shock, and he was quickly weaned
off pressors.  He underwent a cortisol stimulation test, which
showed an AM cortisol of 17, but the level did not respond to
cosyntropin.  Therefore, he was given a 7 day of hydrocortisone
and fludrocortisone for suspected adrenal insufficiency.  Blood
pressures improved and remained stable. He did have a subsequent
transient episode of low blood pressures to 80's systolic, felt
likely to increased pain medications and volume depletion to
poor PO intake. He responded well to NS IVF boluses, and
remained HD stable the remainder of his course. Subsequent
re-check of am cortisol showed a normal level.

ANEMIA
The patient is s/p an extensive prior workup.  During this
hospitalization he was guiac negative.  His HCT was generally in
the low to mid 20s, and he was given a unit of PRBCs with an
appropriate HCT bump.  A reticulocyte count revealed appropriate
marrow production.  Iron studies were repeated during this
admission and were consistent with an anemia of chronic disease,
possibly secondary to his HIV.

HIV
The patient is followed by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**] for his HIV.  He has
been off HAART medications given significant depression and
suicidality at times.  He continues to be on dapsone prophylaxis
for PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] most recent CD4 count was 227 and viral load was
52,000 in [**11-10**].

HCV
Similarly, treatment of his HCV has been deferred.  His most
recent viral load was in [**2140**] was 4,480,000.

Depression
The patient is not currently on treatment for his depression and
did not express any suicidal ideation during this inpatient
stay.  He was seen by [**First Name5 (NamePattern1) 1060**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1061**] while here, with plan to
follow-up in clinic after his rehab stay to readdress any social
needs or possible drug rehabilation program if needed.

PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1065**], viral, atypical PNA.  As pt has h/o
hospitalizations MRSA also possible.  Initially started on
Vancomycin, IV ceftriaxone, azithromycin.  Blooc Cx, sputum
cultures, ua and urine cultures.  He was given supplemental O2.
Plan was for bronchosopy.  While he was at [**Last Name (un) 1066**] he had an
episode where he was noted to be progressively more short of
breath and tachypneic, RR 20.  SpO2 80% on NRB.  pt did not get
bronch and was transferred to MICu for possible intubation.
ABGs on NRB mask 7.46/31/366.  In the MICU he was sating well
after transfer to ICU.  He was weaned of NRB and to 4L NC
quickly.  In discussion with ID, the Zosyn was discontinued, and
he was kept on CTX, vancomycin,a d azithromycin for a probable
CAP. PCp ws felt to be less likely based on improving
oxygenation and radiographic evidence, and so PCP regimen was
[**Name9 (PRE) 1067**].  MS contin and morphine for pain control.  Crypto ag
was negative, CMV vl, [**Name9 (PRE) **] and AFB were sent.  He got a
induced sputum AM of [**2144-2-7**].  There after patient stated that he
wanted to leave the hospital.  Multiple attempts to counsel
patient regarding the risks of leaving by several team memebers
were unsuccessful.  He was given Azithro for 7 days and
Cefpodoxime for 2 weeks for PNA.  He was advised on the results
of induced sputum with PCP and to finish the antibiotics.

Chief Complaint:
found down

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubated; extubated successfully


History of Present Illness:
48 y.o. M with h/o AIDS (CD 4 105 [**11-13**]), HCV, asthma, h/o TB,
h/o PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 1023**] was found down today by VNA [**12-9**] sitting in urine
""indian"" style.  Unknown down time, patient was last seen on
[**2145-12-6**].  Patient was responsive to touch with grimaces, but
not following comands.  [**Name (NI) 1094**] brother was [**Name (NI) 653**] and full code
was confirmed in ED, along with confirmation by PCP.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **]
was subsequently intubated after Etomidate/Succinylcholine.
Patient's VS were 96.8, patient was placed on bearhugger, they
were 101.6 upon transfer to the MICU.  Patient's HR was 122
initially, after given 1 L NS, then 3 L LR, and his HR was down
to 60-70s.  His SBP remained in 140s-160s.  Patient was
oxygenating well on 2L (100%) but was intubated for airway
protection.  Patient was started on propofol gtt for
precautions.  He was started on vanco/zosyn/CTX.
Patient of note recently admitted on [**11-30**] to [**12-2**] after being
found down, however patient left after full completion of
medical therapy.  It is very likely that he is noncompliant with
his medications.
Patient in ED had a L IJ placed, RIJ was attempted but was
complicated by R carotid puncture.  Patient subsequently has a 6
cm hematoma on the R side.  His CTA is also concerning for
possible opportunistic infectious including TB.
ROS: patient unable to provide.

studies:
CT abd/pelvis [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Nodular opacities within a
bronchovascular distribution most notable in the left lung base
and less so on the right most consistent with aspiration
pneumonia given clinical history. However given
immunocompromised status atypical infections including
tuberculosis must be considered and respirtory precautions
advised.  2. Cystic pancreatic tail lesion also noted on study
from [**2141**] without detectable change.  3. Generalized cachexia,
likely AIDS-wasting syndrome
.
CT C-spine [**2145-12-9**]: 1. Right supraclavicular fossa hematoma
corresponding with recent central venous line attempt in this
location.  2. No evidence of acute fracture or dislocation.  3.
Partially imaged right apical opacity and right apical
subpleural blebs.
.
CT head [**2145-12-9**]: 1. No acute hemmorage or mass effect.  2. Mild
cerebral atrophy which is not age appropriate consistent with
HIV encephalopathy.  3. Confluent regions of hypoattenuation in
the deep white matter which is unchanged from [**Month (only) 1096**] yet new
since [**2141**]. While this may represent sequlae of HIV
encephalopathy, an underlying infectious etiology such as PML
may be considered and an MRI may be helpful.
.
CXR [**2145-12-9**]: IMPRESSION:
1. Slightly low lying ET tube, approximately 3 cm above the
carina. This could be withdrawn slightly.
2. Small, patchy opacities at the left lung base which appear to
correspond to tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities seen on previous chest CT
.
MRI head [**2145-12-10**]: 1. No evidence of bacterial or fungal
infection. However, extensive white matter hyperintensity is
often found in patients with HIV encephalopathy.  2. Several
foci of apparent infarction or encephalitis in the corpus
callosum raise the possibility of meningitis.
.
Echo [**2145-12-13**]: The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular
wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Regional left
ventricular wall motion is normal. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). A 24mmHg peak mid-cavitary
gradient is identified. Right ventricular chamber size and free
wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with
trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is
no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2144-2-6**],
left ventricular systolic function is now dynamic with a higher
heart rate and mild resting mid-cavitary gradient.
Is there a history to suggest a high output state (e.g.,
thiamine deficiency, hyperthyroidism, anemia, fever, etc.?

Brief Hospital Course:
48 y.o. M with h/o HIV/AIDs, h/o TB, PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] infections,
noncompliant with his medications, recent history of
falls/traumas found down for possibly three days, minimally
responsive, intubated for airway protection.  The course also
complicated by R neck hematoma due to line placement, alkalosis,
hypernatremia, hypercalcemia, improved ARF, elevated lactate,
transaminitis.

# AMS - multifactorial.  Was found down and c-collar placed.
Came with elevated CKs consistent with Rhabdomyalysis, improved
with IVFs.  Concern for toxic metabilic encephalopathy
(infection, hypernatremia, hypercalcemia) as well as HIV
encephalopathy.  He was intubated for airway protection.  He was
treated with broad ABX as detailed below.  Metabolic
abnormalities improved with IVFs, and he had a negative LP for
infection, but.  MRI was also negative for stroke or mass
lession.  His mental status improved and he was extubated, but
he is not at baseline (he walked out of [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2145-12-1**] after
signing out against medical advise).   CT c-spine was negative
for fracture, but his C-collar was not cleared due to ongoing
altered mental status.  He currently follows some commands but
remains globally weak and will require a neurology consult to
address this and his mental status.  He was given limited
narcotics for pain of undetermined source (seemed in pain with
even light touch to skin).  Would recommend not using too much
narcotics for pain as it will likely cloud mental status.

# ID - AIDs pt not on HAART.   Infectious disease team was
consulted and followed throughout his hospitalization.
Initially, he was covered broadly initially with
vanco/cefepime/flagyl.  He was also on Acycovir to cover for HSV
encephalitis, but this was stopped when CSF was negative for
HSV.  The pt underwent LP and Bronchoscopy.  He had blood,
urine, sputum, stool, and CSF sent for culture.  Stool was
positive for Cdiff on [**2145-12-10**].  He needs to continue on flagyl
for 14 days after all other ABX completed.  Sputum was positive
for MRSA on [**2145-12-10**], and he needs a 14 day course of vancomycin
(currenly, today [**12-16**] is day #8).  He also had pseudomonas
(sparse growth) in sputum and GNRs not otherwise speciated in
his sputum [**2145-12-12**], and Cefepime changed to Zosyn and then to
Meropenem for gram negative coverage.  Meropenem course is 15
days (currently, today [**2145-12-16**] is day #5).  Of note, 1 colony of
Aspergillus was grown on [**2145-12-12**] from sputum and a CT chest was
done on [**2145-12-16**] which did not reveal evidence of invasive
aspergillus.  Galactomannan was sent and needs to be followed
up.  ID recommended NOT to start treatment for aspergillus.  Pt
needs to follow up with ID, Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1059**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1057**], within 2-3 weeks.
Appointment needs to be scheduled.

# Hypernatremia - Felt due to poor free water intake intake and
dehydration while on ground at home.  He was given IVFs and free
H20 and his sodium returned to [**Location 213**] (139 at time of
discharge).

# C-collar - CT c-spine negative, but could not clear collar due
to altered mental status.  Pt needs to have this cleared at
rehab

# Rhabdomylosis - likely due to being down, CK peaked at 3996,
and improved to normal with IVFs.  Renal failure resolved.

# ARF - likely prerenal with component of rhabdomylosis.  Cr 1.6
upon admission, improved to 0.6 by the time of discharge.

# transaminitis - Known Hep C.  Levels were monitored and
trended down to normal by the time of d/c.

# R neck hematoma - stable clinically.  Serial Hcts were checked
and remained stable.

# PPx - H2 [**Hospital1 **], Heparin SQ, senna/colace

# FEN: He was initiated on tube feeds.  He needs a speech and
swallow evaluation to see if he can protect his airway with PO
intake.  Hypernatremia and hypercalcemia resolved with IVFs

Chief Complaint:
seizures, mental status changes

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Lumbar puncture


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 48M w/ HIV/AIDS/HCV/IVDA sent from [**Hospital1 1099**] Rehab for evaluation of 2 witnessed tonic-clonic
seizures.  Seizures occurred on evening [**2146-1-13**], lasted 30
seconds - 1 minute,  resolved spontaneously.  First seizure
occured while he was being cleaned up, second seizure occured
while family member (mother?) was in the room. His nurse
reported 'whole body shaking' L>R, not responsive to name or
sternal rub, dilated pupils, no LOC. Patient w/ foley, so not
able to assess loss of bladder function, no bowel movement
yesterday.  Patient appeared 'sleepy' afterwards but then seemed
to return to his normal self between seizures.  Hypertensive -
received nitropaste.  Afebrile, T max 99.8, BP 116-120's/86-106,
HR 78-129, O2 sat96% on 2L.  Also found to be hypokalemic with K
2.6, started on IVF @10cc/hrKcl 40 mEq [**Hospital1 **] x 6 doses.
.
No nausea/vomiting/diarrhea, no fevers/chills, no seizure
history.
Per brother, patient has had HIV encephalopathy x 1 month, not
completely oriented at baseline. His nurse describes his
baseline as oriented to self only, Spanish speaking with some
English, has sensation of pain to minimal stimulus.
.
ED Course:  arrived [**1-13**] @9pm. Never oriented, drowsy --> very
agitated.  VS 98.5, HR 97, PB 134/89, RR 16, 02 sat 100% on 2L.
Negative head CT.  Midnight - noted to have tonic clonic seizure
activity lasting 1-2 minutes, post-ictal.  O2 sat 100% on non
rebreather, weaned easily.  Given Ceftriaxone 2gm, Vanc 1gm,
Ampicillin 2gm, Acyclovir 700mg. Sedated for LP (2mg Versed and
2mg Ativan).  200mg IV Diflucan for thrush.  Morphine for pain,
received total of 12mg.  Also received 2 gm IV magnesium, NS w/
40 mEq of K x 2L. Hypertensive in 140-150s and tachy up to 130's
throughout ED stay, Tmax 100.9 (not during seizure).
.
After arrival to the ICU, it was discovered that he had a urine
culture positive for acinetobacter at rehab and was started on
imipenem. BCx had reportedly been negative after 5 days.
.
Previous hospitalization ([**Date range (1) 1100**]) for change in MS after
being found down and minimally responsive; he was intubated for
airway protection; course complicated by R neck hematoma [**1-8**] to
line placement, alkalosis, hypernatremia, hypercacemia, improved
ARF, elevated lactate, transaminitis.  Concern for toxic
metabolic encephalopathy, improved somewhat with fluids but did
not return to baseline. Also with rhabdomylosis - CK peaked at
3996, and improved to normal with IVFs, renal failure also
resolved.  He was positive for c-diff, had MRSA positive sputum,
and sparse pseudomonas growth in sputum. When discharged he
needed 6 more days to finish 14 day course of vancomycin, 10
more days to complete 15 day course of meropenem and needed to
continue on flagyl for 14 days after all other ABX completed.

than 1 ppd x 25 years), + h/o IVDA in past, occasional marijuana
use.  No EtOh.  Sexually active ""occasionally"" with one partner,
same partner for several years.

Family History:
NC

Physical Exam:
Admission Physical Exam:
VS: Temp: 98.1 BP: 142/100 HR: 112 RR: 20 O2sat 100% 2L
GEN: agitated, crying out, not oriented, cachectic
HEENT: PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, MM dry, thrush on tongue
NECK: no supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy, no jvd, no
carotid bruits, no thyromegaly or thyroid nodules
RESP: CTA b/l with good air movement throughout
CV: tachy, RR, S1 and S2 wnl, no m/r/g
ABD: nd, +b/s, soft, nt, initially with voluntary guarding but
later without
EXT: no c/c/e, warm, good pulses
SKIN: no rashes/no jaundice
NEURO: AAOx0, unable to cooperate with neuro exam

At discharge, vitals were stable.  The patient was afebrile.
The patient was more oriented.  He was able to communicate his
needs in English.  His neck was rotated the left and he had some
muscular spasm.  His abdomen was benign.  The remained of his
exam was unchanged.

Pertinent Results:
CXR ([**2146-1-23**]): Cardiomediastinal contours are normal. NG tube
tip is in the stomach. There is no pneumothorax or pleural
effusion. The lungs are grossly clear. Surgical clips projecting
over the left supraclavicular area are again noted. Left PICC
remains in place.

EKG: Sinus tachycardia, rate 115 beats per minute. Right atrial
abnormality. Possible old septal myocardial infarction. Possible
left ventricular hypertrophy. Tracing is compatible with
pulmonary disease. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2145-12-9**] QS
complexes in leads V1-V2 are less prominent and there is less
suggestion of possible left ventricular hypertrophy. Both
tracings are compatible with pulmonary disease.

CT Head ([**2146-1-13**]):
FINDINGS: Multiple acquisitions were performed due to patient
compliance. Despite this, there is motion artifact on the study
acquired limiting the evaluation.

There again noted is extensive confluent low attenuation
throughout the deep white matter of the brain. This is likely
related to underlying HIV encephalopathy. There is a advance
atrophy for age which is consistently seen in HIV encephalopathy
as well. There is no acute interval change or midline shift. No
intracranial hemorrhage is evident.

IMPRESSION: Stable head CT examination, although the current
examination is limited as above. Findings most consistent with
HIV encephalopathy with no superimposed acute process.

CT Neck: FINDINGS:

The patient is rotated to the left side, with the neck being
rotated to the left side. Hence, this study is limited in
acquiring the images in a proper manner, centered onto the
midline of the neck. In addition, lack of IV contrast,
significantly limits evaluation for any focal infection.

Within these limitations, there are no large masses noted on the
visualized images of the neck.

However, subtle areas of increased attenuation in the fat and
inflammation cannot be assessed.

There is moderate dilatation of the esophagus with small amount
of fluid/debris within the esophagus. This finding is new
compared to the CT chest on [**2145-12-16**], with interval removal of
the nasogastric tube.
Right-sided PICC line is incompletely included on the present
study.

There are a few surgical clips, noted lateral to the left side
of the thyroid, unchanged in position, compared to the prior CT
chest on [**2145-12-16**].

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.

There is a small 4-mm soft tissue density nodule in the upper
lobe of the left lung, unchanged.

There appears to be resolution of the previously noted
pneumothorax in the apices. However, the chest is not completely
evaluated on the present study.

There is moderate dilatation of the ventricles on the visualized
images of the brain, which was noted on the prior MRI of the
head; however, the brain is incompletely included on the present
study.


Brief Hospital Course:
# Seizures:  The patient had two witnessed tonic-clonic seizures
before presenting to [**Hospital1 18**] ED and one seizure in the ED.  The
most likely etiology for patient's seizures is imipenem which
was used to treat his urine culture positive for acinetobacter
and elavil which was given at high doses for neuropathy. Mr.
[**Known lastname 1071**] is thought to have HIV encephalopathy and this condition
combined with imipenem may have lowered his seizure threshold.
Patient's amitriptyline was also considered as possible cause of
patient's seizures.

Infectious etiology or mass effect were ruled out by [**Hospital 228**]
hospital course, benign appearance of CSF, and head CT;
however, initially the patient was given empiric IV acyclovir,
ceftriaxone, and vancomycin because of suspicion of viral or
bacterial central nervous system infection. Of note, patient has
had no seizures since admission and stopping of imipenem and
amitriptyline. The patient was started on 500 mg levetiracetam
(Keppra) [**Hospital1 **] as anti-seizure medication.  Per the neurology
service, the patient should be on Keppra indefinitely.

# Mental status changes:  The patient's mental status changes
are likely due to HIV encephalopathy.   CT showed no CNS mass
effect and no acute CNS infectious etiology found.  Patient's
mental status changes date back to [**11-13**] admission when patient
left hospital AMA, never having gone back to baseline mental
status s/p presumed fall.   Patient's CMV viral loads were low
(2160) and treatment was deferred since there was no sign
end-organ disease.  The patient was examined by Ophthomaology
who did not see any signs of CMV retinitis.

# Urine:  The patient was found to have acinetobacter in his
urine sensitive to gentamicin.  He was started on a three day
course of IV gentamicin on [**1-26**].  He will need his final dose
today at rehab ([**2146-1-28**]).  Please recheck a UA and culture
tomorrow ([**2146-1-29**]) to confirm his urine has cleared
appropriately.  The patient has also had urinary retention
during this hospitalization.  He failed two voiding trials
during this stay.  As he improves, he can be given another
voiding trial or can follow up with Urology if needed.

# Neck position:  The patient had head turned to left and was
resistant to changing position and has point tenderness
bilaterally on sides of neck.  Neck CT without contrast obtained
(could not use contrast as could not obtain peripheral IV access
necessary) but study was inconclusive due to patient positioning
and lack of contrast.  Patient continuesd to keep head turned to
left with some improvement noted with use of clonazepam.  Please
continue low dose clonazepam to help with muscular spasm.  If
the patient continues to have neck pain, consider re-imaging the
neck.

# Allodynia:  The patient had complaints of allodynia on last
admission and reports of neuropathic pain dating back to [**2142**].
This allodynia may be part of the spectrum of his neuropathy
which is thought to be secondary to HIV.  According to OMR, the
patient has not had relief of his neuropathy with gabapentin in
the past.  However, after patient left ICU for floor, opiates
were held because of worries of sedation affecting mental
status.  His pain was treated with gabapentin and acetaminophen.
 We did not restart his opiates during this hospitalization nor
his Remeron.

# Hypokalemia/hypomagnesmia:  On admission, the patient was
hypokalemic (K of 3.0) and hypomagnesemic (1.1).  Patient's poor
nutrition (albumin of 2.6) and no PO intake most likely cause.
As feeding via NG tube began, lytes were monitored [**Hospital1 **] in order
to assess refeeding syndrome.  At the time of discharge, the
patient's PO intake was improving.  He was able to eat his
entire breakfast with help from the nursing staff.  Please
continue to monitor his electrolytes while he is on TPN at least
daily replete his electrolytes as needed and change TPN based on
electrolytes.  Once he is able to increase his PO intake, please
consider discontinuing the TPN.  Once discontinued, the patient
will not need his electrolytes monitored daily.  Please
discontinue his PICC line once he no longer needs TPN.

# HIV:  The patient is not on HAART (as he has declined it).  ID
did not recommend HAART as HAART carries increased risk of
toxicity in setting of poor nutrition, and patient is vulnerable
to immune reconstitution syndrome with low CD4 count at start of
HAART and patient has known Hepatitis C.  ID's recommendation
was that HAART not be initiated until Mr. [**Known lastname 1101**] nutritional
status improves and that Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**] (outpatient ID doctor for
patient) should make decisions about implementing HAART.
Patient has follow up appointment on [**3-2**] at 9:30 AM with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1057**].  Please continue his Dapsone for PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 1102**].

# Fluid, electrolytes, nutrion:  Patient was profoundly
cachectic, had not eaten in several days and failed a speech and
swallow evaluation.  GI did not wish to place PEG because of
patient's low albumin (which would impede healing) and prominent
epigastric surgical scar.  Patient received NG tube on [**2146-1-21**]
after neck was imaged with CT.  NG tube feeds began at midnight
on night of [**2146-1-21**] at 10 ml/hr.  Rate was increased by 10 ml/hr
every 12 hours with a goal rate of 50 ml/hour acheived at
midnight on Sunday [**2146-1-23**].  However, tube came out and patient
refused replacement.  Patient did ask for tube to be replaced on
[**1-25**] but after primary medical team could not place tube,
patient refused IR placement of NG tube.  Patient was begun on
TPN on [**2146-1-27**].  Patient's lytes were repleted PRN as mentioned
above.  The patient is having improved PO intake and TPN can be
discontinued when patient is taking adequate oral intake.  If
needed, the patient can be re-evaulated by Speech and swallow in
the future.

Despite numerous discussions with the family regarding poor
prognosis, the patient remained full code throughout his
hospital course.

Family History:
Non-contributory

Physical Exam:
98.2, 68, 100/48, RR15, 98% on RA
Gen:  Cachectic appearing elderly male, resting comfortably in
bed, appearing in pain with movement.
Neck: No JVD.
Cor: RR, normal rate, no m/r/g.
Lungs: CTA b/l.
Abd: NABS, soft, NT/ND
Extr: No c/c/e.  R BKA.  Swollen, erythematous R knee,
exquisitely tender.  Trace PT on the L.

Pertinent Results:
[**3-28**] AP, LATERAL AND SUNRISE VIEWS OF THE PATELLA: No prior
studies are available for comparison. There is a horizontal
fracture through the patella with 1.2 cm of displacement of the
fragments anteriorly. There is a small joint effusion. There are
changes from prior BKA, and extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications
are present.
IMPRESSION: Horizontal patellar fracture with 1.2 cm of
displacement anteriorly.

[**3-28**] PELVIS AND RIGHT HIP, THREE VIEWS: There is a transverse
lucency through the femoral neck, which may represent a
nondisplaced fracture. No other fractures or dislocations are
identified. Degenerative changes of the SI and hip joints are
noted. There is diffuse demineralization. Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**]
calcifications and iliac stents are noted.
IMPRESSION: Transverse lucency through the femoral neck, which
may represent a nondisplaced fracture.

[**3-28**] CT PELVIS:  There is a nondisplaced fracture of the
proximal right femoral neck. No other fractures or dislocations
are identified. There is diffuse osteopenia. There is a small
amount of high attenuation fluid within the right hip joint
space, which may represent a small amount of hemorrhage.
Extensive [**Month/Year (2) 1106**] calcifications are seen as are bilateral
iliac stents. Visualized portions of the pelvis are
unremarkable. Soft tissue structures are within normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Nondisplaced fracture of the right femoral neck.


Brief Hospital Course:
78 year old male with extensive medical history, notably
including CAD s/p CABG in [**2117**], MI [**2123**], MIBI with fixed and
reversible defects in [**2129**], CHF with EF 20%, PVD s/p R BKA with
b/l iliac stents, AAA found to be 5.4 x 5.0 cm on recent
abdominal US, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, who uses a RLE
prosthesis for ambulation s/p R BKA, who presents s/p mechanical
fall with R patellar and R femoral neck fractures, here for
orthopedic surgery.

1) Ortho:  Patient is high risk for surgery, however per ortho,
surgery will not be extensive, could be completed in relatively
short time frame, possibly under spinal anesthesia only.
Awaiting cardiolgy consult for estimate of operative risk given
recent MIBI with reversible defects in all territories, and cath
with 3VD.  Patient willing to accept 25-30% chance of operative
mortality.  [**Year (4 digits) **] has seen patient and says o.k. for surgery.
 Limiting factor may be INR, as still 2.9 with 5 mg Vitamin K.
Another 5 mg given, but may need FFP/platelets, and given EF
30%, would likely need to be done under controlled setting in
ICU in case of respiratory distress.  [**Month (only) 116**] defer until tomorrow.
Needs patellar surgery one way or another in order to ever be
able to use prosthesis again.

2) AAA:  Seen by [**Month (only) 1106**].  Will try to get CTA during
hospitalization at some point, though not now in setting of
worsened creatinine.  [**Month (only) 116**] just be able to get abdominal US.
Appreciate [**Month (only) 1106**] consult.  Outpatient repair of AAA.

3) CHF:  Class [**Last Name (LF) 1105**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] 20% in past, though 30% on most recent
cath, currently dry on exam, therefore holding lasix.  If
patient doesn't go to surgery tonight, will order food and will
likely order lasix then.  Also will need lasix with any
FFP/platelets.
-Coumadin for goal INR [**1-10**]

4) PVD:  Bilateral iliac stents, on coumadin, therefore once INR
below 2, will have to start heparin drip.
--recheck INR post second dose of vitamin K, if < 2.0, will
start heparin, and d/c prior to surgery

5) A-fib: As above, holding coumadin.

6) CRI:  Slightly above baseline.  Holding ACE-I.

7) FEN:  K borerline therefore holding ACE-I.  No fluids.  Will
order food if pt. doesn't go to OR.

8) Code: Full.

9) PPx: Heparin drip then transfer to coumadin, senna, colace.

Removed RIJ CVL and placed peripheral IV on [**2132-4-9**]. Hct 29.7 on
discharge. Needs daily Hct and INR. Transfuse Hct<28 and keep
INR [**1-10**].

.
The patient was in her usual state of health until this AM. At
that time she was found by nursing home staff in respiratory
distress with O2 sats of 70% on RA. EMS was contact[**Name (NI) **] and she
was started on supplemental oxygen with NRB and O2 sats
responded to 98%. She was also noted to be hot (no document of
temperature) with cough and green sputum. She was transported to
[**Hospital1 18**] ED.
.
In the ED, initial vitals were: T 99.8, HR 90, BP 171/85, RR 28,
SaO2 98% NRB15L. EKG with Afib RVR to 130s and LVH. SBP 180s.
WBC 16. BNP 12,600. CXR interpreted as concerning for CHF. She
was given nitroglycerin gtt, diltiazem 10mg IV x2, aspirin,
levofloxacin and furosemide 20mg IV x1. Per documents she
received 2L IVF. She was temporarily started on BIPAP however
did not tolerate well with hypotension and tachycardia. This was
discontinued and patient has been stable with vitals at transfer
of HR 105, BP 129/66, RR 26, SaO2 100% NRB.
.
Currently, no distress although neglects left side. No movement
of left side. No respiratory distress.

.
IMAGING:
[**2179-1-29**] EKG #1: Atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Clinical correlation is suggested. No previous
tracing available for comparison.

[**2179-1-29**] EKG #2: Atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular
response. Non-specific intraventricular conduction delay. Left
ventricular hypertrophy. Poor R wave progression could be due to
left ventricular hypertrophy. Non-specific ST-T wave changes
could be due to left ventricular hypertrophy, although cannot
exclude ischemia. Compared to tracing #1 ventricular rate is
slower.

[**2179-1-29**] CXR:
1. Mild pulmonary edema.
2. Mild cardiomegaly.
3. Hyperexpanded lungs, could be due to emphysema.

[**2179-1-29**] CTA Head/Neck:
1. Acute right MCA distribution infarction with acute occlusion
demonstrated within the right middle cerebral artery. No
collateral flow.
2. No evidence of vascular dissection. Mild atherosclerotic
plaque as
detailed above.

Brief Hospital Course:
85 year old female with a history of schizophrenia and dementia
who presented in repiratory distress and was found to have a new
MCA stroke. After goals of care discussion with patient's
guardian, she was made comfort measures only, and expired on
[**2179-2-2**].

#. Respiratory Distress: Patient's O2 sats were in high 90s on
NRB on arrival to ED.  She was noted to be in afib with RVR, and
CXR was concerning for pulmonary edema.  Patient was treated
with nitro gtt, diltiazem, aspirin, levofloxacin and furosemide.
BiPAP attempted, but patient did not tolerate well; developed
hypotension and increased tachycardia.  She was admitted to the
ICU for further evaluation and management of respiratory
distress. After Code Stroke called on arrival to ICU in setting
of left hemiparesis (see below), and imaging revealed large R
MCA infarct, decision was made to focus on comfort care only.
Patient transferred to floor, where she received morphine as
needed for pain and SOB.
.
#. CVA: On arrival to ICU, patient was noted to have left
hemiparesis.  Code Stroke called, and CT Head/Neck revealed
right MCA infarct. Given the history of recent falls and her
limited pre-stroke functionality, the decision was made not to
give heparin or tPA.  After discussion with the patient's
guardian, it was felt that she would not want to pursue
aggressive treatment given poor prognosis, and patient was made
CMO.
.
#. Atrial fibrillation: Patient noted to be in afib with RVR on
presentation.  She was initially on diltiazem gtt, but this was
discontinued once patient made CMO.
.
#. Rash: Patient noted to have papular rash on erythematous
background on neck and abdomen.  Was felt to be most likely
secondary to a drug rash.  Of note, patient received lasix,
which may have caused reaction as patient has history of sulfa
allergy.  Patient received sarna lotion as needed, as well as
hydrocortisone cream.
.
#. Goals of care: Per discussion with patient's guardian,
patient's code status changed to comfort measures only.  Plan
was for discharge back to skilled nursing facility with hospice,
however patient expired on [**2179-2-2**] prior to discharge.  Her
guardian was notified, and declined an autopsy.

History of Present Illness:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased donor renal transplant, HTN, and
diverticulitis who was initially admitted for worsening
abdominal pain and N/V and now presents to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with
hypotension after having a n ex-lap and bowel resection for a
perforated cecum.  She has had approximately 3 episodes of
diverticulitis in the past year which resolved with antibiotics.
 She was planning to have an elective outpatient laparoscopic
colectomy given her frequent flares.  Prior to this admission,
she reportedly had intermittent [**10-3**] abdominal pain in the RLQ
and LLQ and significant nausea and vomiting, she was unable to
keep down any POs for 48 hours prior to admission.  This felt
worse than her prior diverticulitis flares and she was admitted
for observation, hydration, and antibiotics.  CT abd/pelvis at
admission showed pericolonic stranding but no e/o
diverticulitis.

Since admission to the surgery service, she was staretd on Cipro
and Flagyl for the colitis seen on CT.  Her abdominal pain
acutely worsened on [**5-12**] and she described feeling a ""[**Doctor Last Name **]"" in
her abdomen.  A repeat CT abd/pelvis showed perforation at the
cecum with free air present and extravasation of PO contrast
into the peritoneum.  She was taken to the OR for a ex-lab where
she was found to have a stricture in the signoid colon and a
perforation in her cecum with spillage of stool in to the
peritoneum.  She underwent a right and left colectomy, the
transverse colon was left in place but is discontinusous.  Her
abdomen was left open after the procedure.

PORTABLE ABDOMEN Study Date of [**2114-5-12**] 8:07 PM
Supine and decubitus view of the abdomen shows pneumoperitoneum,

not present on the abdomen CT [**5-11**], but detected on the chest
radiograph
performed concurrently and reported prior to review of this
study. Retained contrast [**Doctor Last Name 360**] in the cecum shows its diameter
is 8 cm.  Proximal to it, the small bowel is moderately
distended to a diameter of 28 mm.  A subsequent abdominal CT
scan also available at the time of this review shows the effects
of likely cecal perforation.

IMAGING:
-[**5-12**] CT Abd:
IMPRESSION:
1.  There is evidence of new bowel perforation at the level of
the cecum, with evidence of new free air, free fluid, as well as
extraluminal oral contrast surrounding the cecum.  Surgical
consultation is recommended.
2.  Pericolonic stranding is again noted diffusely throughout
the colon and greatest throughout the descending and sigmoid
colon.  These findings are most consistent with diffuse colitis
which has likely led to perforation.
3. New small bilateral pleural effusions

Cardiovascular Report ECG Study Date of [**2114-5-14**]  11:12:58 AM
Sinus rhythm with low amplitude P waves. Low QRS voltage
throughout.
Delayed R wave transition. Diffuse non-specific T wave
flattening. Compared to the previous tracing of [**2112-7-15**] the
voltage is lower. P wave amplitude has decreased. Diffuse T wave
flattening is present. Clinical correlation is suggested.

CHEST (PORTABLE AP) Study Date of [**2114-5-15**] 3:19 AM
No acute cardiopulmonary process.  Low endotracheal tube
position.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 1119**], a patient known to the colorectal surgery service,
presented to the emergency department on [**2114-5-11**] with nausea,
vomiting, and abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with
diverticulitis and she was evaluated by the acute care service
in the emergency department and a plan was formulated with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] to admit the patient for abdominal exams, antibiotics and
rehydration with plan to monitor and expedite surgical plans
based on her medical history and sudden relapse of symptoms
while on outpatient antibiotic therapy. Nephrology was consulted
for advice related to immunosuppression medications and past
renal transplant and followed the patient for the duration of
her inpatient admission. On [**2114-5-12**] the patient was monitored
closely. She was started on a clear liquid diet and was given a
Dulcolax Supp x1 and had 2 bowel movements. She remained
distended and was given a dose of milk of magnesia. The patient
was improving when she had a sudden onset of abdominal pain. CT
revealed extravasation of contrast and she was taken to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for exploratory laparotomy and
two segmental colectomies, was left with open abdomen and
disconnected and because of the difficult case and condition of
bowel as described in the operative note, the patient was
transferred to the intensive care unit appropriate drains. On
[**2114-5-14**] the patient returned to the operating room with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] after stabilization in the ICU for washout, completion
proctectomy and colectomy, ileostomy and closure of the abdomen
with retention sutures and staples. The patient was transferred
to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and the course of ICU care is described below.

[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] Course per [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] resident:
60F with ESRD s/p deceased renal transplant in [**2095**] on
immunosuppression, HTN and h/o diverticulitis who presented to
the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] with hypotension after ex-lap with right/left
hemicolectomy performed for cecal perforation and sigmoid
stricture.
.
#Cecal perforation s/p colectomy:  The cause of her perforation
was thought to be a sigmoid stricture which was found
intraoperatively, likely related to her multiple episodes of
diverticulitis.   She had a primary anastomosis and loop
ileostomy. She was commenced on vanc/Zosyn for an 8 day course
per surgery, and was maintained on a morphine PCA prn. She was
intubated for the procedure, but was quickly and successfully
weaned off of the vent prior to callout to the surgical floor.
.
# Hypertension ?????? Her initial hypotension resolved, and her home
anti-hypertensives were recommenced due to her hx of HTN.
.
#ESRD s/p renal transplant: renal transplant recs were followed,
and after her procedure, she was restarted on azathioprine, and
transitioned to a 5mg daily dose of prednisone. She was
restarted on cyclosporine per renal transplant on [**5-17**]. .
#Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis: Resolved. Likely related to
volume resuscitation with NS. Chloride is also elevated which
supports this.
.
#Anemia: Hct trending down almost 10 points compared to her
pre-op CBC.  Likely from blood loss during her colectomy as well
as dilutional effect from multiple fluid boluses.  She was also
hemoconcentrated at admission from poor PO intake and has
baseline anemia with Hct in the 24-32 range from her ESRD s/p
transplant. She was transfused with packed red blood cells. She
was monitored closely.

The patient was extubated and started on a clear liquid diet on
[**2114-5-17**].

Surgical Floor Course:

The patient was transferred to the inpatient floor on [**2114-5-18**]
and began a regular diet. She was continued on her antibiotic
course. [**2114-5-19**] the Foley was removed at midnight. The patient
had temporary central venous access which was not ideal for the
floor and because of intravenous antibiotics and the patient's
access status  unable to place PICC line after multiple
attempts. IR was unable to schedule the patient for IR placement
of the PICC line. The nursing staff continued to use the CVL for
access. On [**2114-5-20**] the patient was voiding. She was given
vancomycin 500x1, troughs were monitored closely at the patient
was a renal transplant patient and she was strated on pain
medications by mouth. [**2114-5-21**] Renal transplant fellow:
recommend continuing home dose of immunosuppression medications.
JP drains were removed. The patient was meeting discharge
criteria. She was followed closely throughout her admission by
the wound/ostomy nursing team as well as physical therapy. After
consultation with the nephrology team the patient was started on
a 14 day course of Augmentin started and fluconazole and Zosyn
were discontinued. The PICC line was pulled back to midline
position and the central venous line was removed without issue.
Her cyclosporine trough was monitored closely throughout her
hospitalization as there was a risk of interaction with
fluconazole. Her last trough was 112 on [**2114-5-19**]. She continued
her Cyclosporine and was discharged on appropriate dosing. The
patient was ordered to have the Cyclosporine trough measured
prior to the morning dose on [**2114-5-24**] and dose adjustment with
assistance of the renal transplant center. Arrangements were
arranged for the patient to be transferred to a rehabilitation
facility appropriately as she had become deconditioned. The
midline catheter was removed at time of discharge.

Discharge Disposition:
Extended Care

Facility:
[**Hospital **] Hospital for Continuing Medical Care - [**Location (un) 1121**]
([**Hospital3 1122**] Center)

Discharge Diagnosis:
Sigmoid diverticulitis with abscess and stricture, perforated
cecum


Discharge Condition:
Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
Activity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.


Discharge Instructions:
You were admitted to the hospital after a laparoscopic
Colectomy for surgical management of your diverticulitis.
Unfortunately after this procedure you were found to have a
stricture and leaking into your abdomen which required you to be
taken back to the operating room for a completion colectomy and
end ileostomy. Closure of the surgical incision required
placement of retention sutures which remain in place and will
stay in place along with the staples until you return for your 2
weeks post-operative visit. You have recovered from this
procedure and you are now ready to return home. Samples from
your colon were taken and this tissue has been sent to the
pathology department for analysis. You will receive these
pathology results at your follow-up appointment. If there is an
urgent need for the surgeon to contact you regarding these
results they will contact you before this time. You have
tolerated a regular diet, passing gas and your pain is
controlled with pain medications by mouth. You may return home
to finish your recovery. It is important that you continue to
have your immunosupression medications monitored for your kidney
transplant. Please have your level checked at rehab the morning
of [**2114-5-24**] and the goal of the cyclosporin level is 50-100. The
rehab should fax this level to the renal transplant office after
it is back for recommendations at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 697**]. This will be
ordered in your paperwork however, it is the facilities
responsibility to order the test.

Please monitor your bowel function closely. If you have any of
the following symptoms please call the office for advice or go
to the emergency room if severe: increasing abdominal
distension, increasing abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting,
inability to tolerate food or liquids, elevated ileostomy
output. You have a new ileostomy. The most common complication
from a new ileostomy placement is dehydration. The output from
the stoma is stool from the small intestine and the water
content is very high. The stool is no longer passing through the
large intestine which is where the water from the stool is
reabsorbed into the body and the stool becomes formed. You must
measure your ileostomy output for the next few weeks. The output
from the stoma should not be more than 1200cc or less than
500cc. If you find that your output has become too much or too
little, please call the office for advice. The office nurse or
nurse practitioner can recommend medications to increase or slow
the ileostomy output. Keep yourself well hydrated, if you notice
your ileostomy output increasing, take in more electrolyte drink
such as Gatorade. Please monitor yourself for signs and symptoms
of dehydration including: dizziness (especially upon standing),
weakness, dry mouth, headache, or fatigue. If you notice these
symptoms please call the office or return to the emergency room
for evaluation if these symptoms are severe. You may eat a
regular diet with your new ileostomy. However it is a good idea
to avoid fatty or spicy foods and follow diet suggestions made
to you by the ostomy nurses.

Please monitor the appearance of the ostomy and stoma and care
for it as instructed by the wound/ostomy nurses. The stoma
(intestine that protrudes outside of your abdomen) should be
beefy red or pink, it may ooze small amounts of blood at times
when touched and this should subside with time. The skin around
the ostomy site should be kept clean and intact. Monitor the
skin around the stoma for bulging or signs of infection listed
above. Please care for the ostomy as you have been instructed by
the wound/ostomy nurses. You will be able to make an appointment
with the ostomy nurse in the clinic 7 days after surgery. You
will have a visiting nurse at home for the next few weeks
helping to monitor your ostomy until you are comfortable caring
for it on your own. The bridge will be removed from the
ileostomy at your follow-up appointment with the wound/ostomy
nurses.

You have a long vertical incision on your abdomen that is closed
with staples and retention sutures. This incision can be left
open to air or covered with a dry sterile gauze dressing if the
staples become irritated from clothing. The staples will stay in
place until your first post-operative visit at which time they
can be removed in the clinic, most likely by the office nurse.
Please monitor the incision for signs and symptoms of infection
including: increasing redness at the incision, opening of the
incision, increased pain at the incision line, draining of
white/green/yellow/foul smelling drainage, or if you develop a
fever. Please call the office if you develop these symptoms or
go to the emergency room if the symptoms are severe. You may
shower, let the warm water run over the incision line and pat
the area dry with a towel, do not rub.

No heavy lifting for at least 6 weeks after surgery unless
instructed otherwise by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1120**] or Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You may
gradually increase your activity as tolerated but clear heavy
exercise with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. You must continue to wear the
abdomoinal binder with a whole cut for the ileostomy to fit
under at least until your second post-operative visit with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **]. He will give you further instructions at this time.

You will be prescribed a small amount of the pain medication
Please take this medication exactly as prescribed. You may take
Tylenol as recommended for pain. Please do not take more than
4000mg of Tylenol daily. Do not drink alcohol while taking
narcotic pain medication or Tylenol. Please do not drive a car
while taking narcotic pain medication.
Thank you for allowing us to participate in your care! Our hope
is that you will have a quick return to your life and usual
activities. Good luck!

space, small amount of subarachnoid blood along the frontal
gyri.  The patient had a carotid cerebral angiogram on
[**2131-10-16**] under monitored anesthesia care.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Mr. [**Known lastname 1127**] was admitted to the Intensive
Care Unit for blood pressure control.  Systolic blood
pressure was maintained below 140 mm of mercury.  During this
time, further surgical intervention was discussed with Mr.

very much against any surgical intervention at this point and
there was a gradual improvement in his medical condition.

The cerebral angiogram showed a faint region of early
arteriovenous shunting in the left parietal occipital region
which is concerning for a very slow residual arteriovenous
malformation located anteriorly relative to the previous
craniotomy site.  The recommendation was made to repeat this
angiographic study after the mass effect from the hematoma
was partially resolved.

STUDIES:
[**11-23**] Foot Xray:
1) Sensitivity for osteomyelitis somewhat limited by overlying
bandage.
2) Osteopenia, which is worse compared with [**2195-9-23**] and probably
slightly worse compared with [**2195-11-14**], but without definite
discrete bone destruction. Please see comment.

[**2195-11-24**]: TTE: Suboptimal image quality. Mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy with preserved global biventricular
systolic function. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2195-9-25**], a
left pleural effusion and mild pulmonary artery systolic
hypertension are now identified.

[**2195-11-25**]: Chest xray: In comparison with the earlier study of
this date, there is continued enlargement of the cardiac
silhouette. On the lateral view, there is substantial bilateral
pleural effusion. No evidence of vascular congestion.

[**2195-11-25**] Foot xray: Since the previous study, there has been
debridement at the first MTP joint.
Cortical irregularity at the base of the first proximal phalanx
and of the first metatarsal head is seen. There is gauze
material seen at the surgical site. There are prominent spurs
about the calcaneal tuberosity. There is a lot of soft tissue
swelling. Please refer to the operative note for additional
details.

[**2195-11-30**] Foot XR - There appears to have been resection of the
distal first metatarsal and base of the first proximal phalanx.
There is an overlying skin defect and associated subcutaneous
emphysema. Direct comparison to the [**2195-11-25**] films is limited
due to overlying bandage, but the bone resection is new compared
with [**2195-11-23**]. No other areas of focal osteolysis are identified
at this time.

PATHOLOGY:
[**2195-11-25**]
1.  Sesamoid, left foot (A):
-  Trabecular bone fragments with marrow fibrosis, acute
osteomyelitis and osteonecrosis.
- Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
2.  Bone, left first metatarsal head (B-C):
-  Trabecular bone with marrow fibrosis, acute osteomyelitis and
osteonecrosis.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.
3.  Bone, base of hallux left foot (D):
-  Trabecular bone with focal osteonecrosis, acute inflammation,
marrow fibrosis, and extensive remodelling.
-  Hyaline cartilage with focal acute inflammation.

[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, proximal phalanx, excision (A):
- Markedly reactive bone with acute inflammation.
[**2195-11-30**] Left foot, clearing fragment, excision (B):
-   Bone with marked reactive changes.



Brief Hospital Course:
68 yo man with type 2 diabetes melitus, atrial fibrilation, and
chronic left foot osteomyelitis with cellulitis was admitted
with hypoglycemia and bradycardia.

1. Hypoglycemia: He was initially admitted to the ICU given
persistent hypoglycemia in the setting of recent bactrim use
with glipizide, which was thought to prolong the effects of the
glipizide. He required D50 boluses and an octreotide drip with
D10 in the ICU to maintain his blood sugar. His blood sugar
improved from 30's to 300's and the octreotide drip and D10 drip
were stopped. After his multiple podiatric procedures were
performed, his oral hypoglycemics were restarted and his blood
sugars remained stable between 80-200.

2. Bradycardia: Noted on admission, thought secondary to
elevated digoxin level and interaction with bactrim. His digoxin
and verapamil were initially held. They were then both restarted
once his many procedures were completed, and his heart rate
remained between 60-80s.

3. Left osteomyelitis and cellulitis: He was treated with
vancomycin, ciprofloxacin and flagyl starting [**2195-11-23**]. He
underwent bone resection with podiatry [**2195-11-25**]. Based on
culutre results, pan-sensitive mssa and enterococcus, so
antibiotics were changed to unasyn on [**2195-11-28**]. He was taken
back to the OR for wound closure on [**2195-11-30**]. He was then
transitioned to augmentin. He was recommended to continue
augmentin at least until he follows up with his primary
podiatrist on [**2195-12-7**] at which time length of treatment course
will be decided. He was evaluated by physical therapy on the day
prior to discharge, and he was cleared to go home with home PT.
He was recommended to remain non-weight bearing on his left
foot.

4. Benign hypertension: The patient has chronic hypertension
with poor blood pressure control. In the intensive care unit,
his systolic blood pressure rose to almost 200, requiring
treatment with hydralazine. The patient's home verapamil was
continued, but his lisinopril was discontinued due to
hyperkalemia. Lasix was used as needed for volume overload and
his lisinopril was restarted with improved blood pressure
control.

5. Volume overload: The patient developed increased work of
breathing and volume overload in the setting of his D10 drip.
The D10 drip was discontinued, and patient was treated with
Lasix, with improvement in his symptoms.

6. Type II Diabetes melitus, uncontrolled with complications:
His oral agents were held in house as above and glycemic control
achieved with sliding scale of insulin. He was restarted on both
his metformin and glipizide 24 hours prior to discharge, and his
blood sugars remained stable between 80-200.

7. Atrial fibrillation: He was rate controlled with verapamil
and digoxin. He is chronically anticoagulated with coumadin, and
was admitted with an inr of 9.3. He had no bleeding. He was
given vitamin k, with gradual improvement in his inr. His
coumadin was held. This was restarted on [**2195-11-30**], and his INR
was 2 on discharge.

8. Chronic diastolic heart failure: He was treated with
intermittent diuresis for volume overload. He was restarted on
ace inhibitor.

9. Anemia: He was noted to have anemia of chronic disease, with
stable hct.
