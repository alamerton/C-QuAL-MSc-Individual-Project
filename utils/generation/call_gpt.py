            You are given a set of discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III 
            database. Your task is to generate a question and answer pair that is relevant 
            to clinical practice.

            Clinically relevant questions should test the ability to summarize, 
            identify, and arrange text, and answer specific questions related to:
            - Treatment
            - Assessment
            - Diagnosis
            - Problems or complications
            - Abnormalities
            - Etiology
            - Medical history

            The question should also be one of the following types:
            - Yes/No/Maybe
            - Unanswerable
            - Temporal
            - Factual
            - Summarisation
            - Identification

            Your response should also contain short, one-sentence rationale behind 
            the answer detailing the reason why the answer is correct.

            Do not create a question that is too easy to answer, only clinicians 
            should be able to answer the question. Do not create a question that 
            can be answered without referring to the discharge summary. Do not
            create a question-answer pair with exactly matching details.

            Please follow this format:

            Question: [Insert your clinical question here]
            Answer: [Insert the corresponding answer here]
            Type: [Your chosen question type from the list, spelled the same]
            Reason: [Short explanation for the answer, based on the discharge 
            summaries]

            If there are multiple discharge summaries, each will be provided 
            between [Discharge summary n start] and [Discharge summary n end] 
            where n is the number corresponding to the discharge summary being 
            given. The discharge summaries are provided in chronological order.

            Here are the discharge summaries for you to work on:

            {discharge_summary_string}

            Please provide a clinically relevant question and answer based on the 
            above discharge summary.
